    "## Communication Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "> A protocol is a predefined set of rules for communicating. The protocol tells computers how to format the message when sending it and how to interpret the raw data when receiving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common computer protocols which you might have heard of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __HTTP__ (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is one of the most common protocols\n",
    "- __HTTPS__ is a secure implementation of HTTP. It encrypts messages using a protocol called TLS (Transport Layer Security). When you see a padlock next to the URL in your browser, you're receiving data from that website via HTTPS. When your browser gives you a scary warning, you're probably connecting over HTTP. The security provided by TLS was formerly implemented by another protocol called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).\n",
    "- __SSH__ (Secure SHell) is a protocol that allows secure communication over an insecure network (where other devices may see your messages), like the internet. It does this by encrypting messages using a public and private key, where both are required to decrypt the message.\n",
    "- __IP__ (Internet Protocol) is a protocol which ensures that packets (basically chunks) of a message get sent to the correct computer\n",
    "- __DNS__ (Domain Name Server) is a protocol that maps human-readable urls like `https://www.theaicore.com` to their IP address, such as `192.0.2.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "A __request__ is a message sent from one computer to another. Typically, a __response__ is returned to the opposite direction. A request must be sent using a protocol, which tells both computers the rules for how to send and interpret messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be making HTTP requests to existing APIs."

    "## Client vs server\n",
    "\n",
    "You will commonly hear about the _client_, which is the computer initiating the request (asking for the Pokemon), and the _server_, which is the computer handling the request (returning the Pokemon info).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, there is no difference between the two computers. The server and the client just represent two different software programs. They could be running on the exact same hardware. In fact, they could be running on the exact same computer! This is commonly the case when developing an API or web application locally."
