    "# APIs and Requests - Types and Response Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different types of API. Here's what you need to know for now:\n",
    "- __REST APIs__ are by far the most common type of API. REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. They expect HTTP requests. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\n",
    "- __HTTP APIs__ are a legacy version of REST APIs.\n",
    "- __Websocket APIs__ enable not only the client to be able to initiate requests to the server, but for the server to initiate requests to the client. This is 2-way communication is commonly used in instant messaging applications, where a server sits between two (or more) users listening for messages from one user and then sends the intended recipients the message by initiating a request to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite how much we have talked about HTTP, but we are actually going to exclusively working with REST APIs. Still, many concepts also apply to other types of API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Response Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "If we print our API response, we will see that is comes with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the status code using the `.status_code` attribute of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the \"__status code__\"."

    "- Each API response comes with a number called the _response/status code_\n",

    "- A _header_ is a piece of information sent along with an API request \n",
    "- Common header information includes: authentication codes, media types and CORS\n",
    "- One way for a user to identify themselves is to use a _token_ and add it to the header of the request. Tokens are used for authentication. \n",
