    "## Apache Maven\n",
    "\n",
    "> Apache Maven is a build tool designed for managing and uniformly building any Java-based project. By defining your project in a __project object model(POM)__ Maven can build the project into __Java Archive(JAR)__ files which are easily distributed on Mavens central repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Maven as a build tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Maven is a __build tool__. So what does this mean and how can this help us? __Build tools__ are programs which help in the automation of __building, testing, compiling, and deployment__ of __source code__ into a useable application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maven was defined to meet these objectives:\n",
    "- Make the build process easy \n",
    "- Provide a uniform build process\n",
    "- Provide quality project information\n",
    "- Encourage better development practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Maven as a build tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normally used for Java based projects, complies code usually into `JAR` files but other types can be specified. \n",
    "- Keeps project build consistent through the use of __POM__ file which describes the __project structure, dependencies, configuration__ and __licenses__ when build your project.\n",
    "- Automates testing of the file during the build process.\n",
    "- Encourages sharing built projects on the Maven central repository https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central to share with other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The POM file\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a project it can rely on many different dependencies critical to its function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating between many different websites can be tedious to find the correct versions and many different dependencies required for your project. This is what the __POM file__ is designed to solve, it gives you a uniform structure to define your project in code when building it.\n",
    "\n",
    "POM files are a representation of your Maven project written in `XML` and stored in a `pom.xml` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you will define dependencies, build configuration, licensing, and even the URL of where the project lives. The general layout and configurable tags are shown here:\n",
