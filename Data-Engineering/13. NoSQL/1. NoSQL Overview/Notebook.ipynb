    "\n",
    "## What is NoSQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL is shorthand for: Not Only SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "> They are distributed data stores used to store, manage and interact with semi-structured and unstructured data (but can also manage structured data).\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL stores are distributed, meaning that they run on not just one machine but many. Doing this means that the storage limits increase with the number of machines on the system, so they can scale hugely. That means that the whole dataset might be spread across 100 computers. Often, these data stores also have replicas of the data, in case of machines failing and data being lost on one of those replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, organizations have used relational databases to capture their data and query it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, companies started seeing limitations of traditional relational databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Emergence of new data types such as videos and images due to the rapid adoption of the Internet, social media and IoT devices (variety)\n",
    "-   Increasing rate of data generation (velocity)\n",
    "-   Growing size of data files (for instance, video files can be much larger than CSVs) (volume)\n",
    "-   Relational databases have no flexibility. If you want to add a column, you would need to consider how this relates to other data, and populate it's values for all other rows. This can make it difficult to maintain the database schema as it changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, a new group of technologies, termed NoSQL, started to emerge to address these limitations. The first time the term NoSQL was introduced was in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi, who gave the name to his first open-source database that was created at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__History of NoSQL__:\n",
    "- 1998 - Carlo Strozzi used the term NoSQL for his lightweight, open-source database\n",
    "- 2000 - Graph database Neo4j launched\n",
    "- 2004 - Google BigTable launched\n",
    "- 2005 - CouchDB launched\n",
    "- 2007 - The research paper on Amazon Dynamo is released\n",
    "- 2008 - Facebooks open-sources the Cassandra project\n",
    "- 2009 - The term NoSQL was reintroduced and tools are rapidly being adopted\n"

    "### Document-oriented\n",
    "\n",
    "> A document-oriented data store maintains information within documents like CML, YAML or JSON rather than storing data as rows and columns. To organize these documents in one unit, there is a specific key assigned to each document. They are currently one of the most popular types of NoSQL used by global companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _document_ is a record in a document data store. A document typically stores all the information about _one object_ and any of its related metadata. Documents store data in key-value pairs. The values can be a variety of types and structures, including strings, numbers, dates, arrays, or objects. Documents can be stored in formats like JSON, BSON, and XML. We can consider this type of NoSQL as a more complex version of the key-value data store.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though document stores do not have a unified schema, they are usually organized in a way to enable easy access and analaysis of the data. This means they can be considered to be semi-structured data. Seeing that each complete object is commonly stored in a single document, there is generally no need for defining relationships between documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "These documents are in no way similar to tables of a relational database; they do not have a set number of fields, strict rules on data types, etc. Missing data is simply omitted rather than there being an empty field or NULL values. Data can be added, edited, removed and queried relatively easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _keys_ assigned to each document are unique identifiers required to access data within the data store, usually a path, string or a uniform resource identifier. IDs tend to be automatically incrementing indices (the 3rd row will have an id = 3) rather than UUIDs to speed up data retrieval. \n",
    "\n",
    "The content of documents within a document store is usually specified in _metadata_ files corresponding to each document. They allow document data stores \"understand\" the structure of the corresponding document information -- whether a field contains addresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Querying in document data stores vs SQL\n",
    "For improved efficiency and user experience, many document stores have query languages, which allow querying documents based on the metadata or the actual document content. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Strengths of document-oriented data stores\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Flexibility__: \n",
    "    - Documents of one data store do not require a specific schema or have to be of the same type\n",
    "    - A flexible schema means that the data model can evolve as the requirements change\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Easy to update__:\n",
    "    -  With document stores, you can add new pieces of information easily to specific documents only \n",
    "    -  In contrast, in a relational database, new pieces of information might affect other tables as well\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Improved read and write speed compared to relational databases__:\n",
    "    -   In NoSQL document stores you can find everything you need within one document. With everything kept in a single location, it is much faster to reach and retrieve the data.\n",
    "        - One reason for that is the schemaless architecture. As there is no schema, adding or updating data doesn't require any upfront validations (as is the case in a SQL database). This provides a larger count of write operations per second.\n",
    "        - Another reason is that due to data normalization in SQL databases, many joins might be required to retrieve data. Joins are resource-intensive operations. In document data stores, no joins are required as the related data is generally stored as it is in one big document.\n",
    "    - This, of course, is a trade-off.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rich API's and query lanaguges__:\n",
    "    -   Due to the popularity of document-oriented data stores, there is a wide variety of industry-grade API's and querying tools available to use. Other NoSQL stores do not have such tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of document-oriented data stores\n",
    "- __Document size limit__:\n",
    "    -   The popular document data stores usually have a limit on the size of each document it can store. For example, MongoDB has a limit of 16mb as the maximum size per document. If the size exceeds this limit, we'll need to create an additional document which can be a hassle.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Difficulty joining documents__:\n",
    "    -   Implementing joins in document data stores can be very difficult or even impossible (depending on how the data is structured)\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- __High disk storage usage__:\n",
    "    -   Due to data replication for backups, there is an increase in data redundancy which requires more disk storage and is obviously more costly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Content management systems (CMS)__:\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to their flexible schema, document data stores are ideal for storing and analysing any type of data including images and videos in real-time.

    "  - Key value databases are quite simple to use. The straightforward commands make work easier for data engineers.\n",

    "\n",
    "- __Simplicity__:\n",
    "  - Although this was also listed as a strength, the simplicity of key-value data stores can also make certain things hard. For example, there is no language nor straightforward means that allows querying with anything else other than the key.\n",

    "- __No unified query language__:\n",
    "  - Unlike SQL, which is (roughly) the same across all databases, different key-value data stores have their own way to query keys. Without a unified query language to use, queries from one data store may not be transportable into a different key-value store.\n",

    "### Top use cases\n",

    "  - A session-oriented application, such as a web application, starts a session when a user logs in and is active until the user logs out or the session times out\n",

    "  - Session data may include: user profile information, messages, personalized data and themes, recommendations, targeted promotions, and discounts\n",

    "### Columnar-oriented\n",
    "\n",
    "> Column-based (sometimes called wide-column-based) are another type of NoSQL data store. In column-oriented stores, data is stored in _cells_ grouped in columns of data rather than as rows of data, like we are used to in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a columnar data store provides certain benefits over traditional relational databases.  One of the main benefits is the faster read-query performance because the column design keeps the data physically closer together, which reduces the seek time especially when only certain columns are required.  Another benefit is that columnar data stores are more efficient at compressing data (since it's closer together) and can have better compression ratios over relational databases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases have a set schema and they function as tables of rows and columns. Wide-column data stores have a similar, but different schema. They also have rows and columns. However, they are not fixed within a table, but rather have a _dynamic_ schema. Each column is stored separately. If there are similar (related) columns, they are joined into _column families_ and then the column families are stored separately from other column families. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help visualise this, take a look at the below diagram (note how the data is stored):\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/columnar.png\" width=600>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The _row key_ is the first column in each column family, and it serves as an identifier of a row. Furthermore, each column after that has a column key (name). It identifies columns within rows and thus enables the querying of the columns. Column families can contain a virtually unlimited number of columns that can be created at runtime or while defining the schema. Read and write is done using columns rather than rows. Column families are groups of similar data that is usually accessed together. As an example, we often access customer names and profile information at the same time, but not the information on their orders. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of what a row key looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/columnar-row-key.png\" width=600>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at a real example with some data. Below are 3 records containing `User Profile` information. We can see that we have 3 rowkeys (Bob, Britney and Tori). For each _rowkey_, we have a number of columns. Each column consists of a name (key) and some values. Note that for the first rowkey (Bob), we have 3 columns (emailAddress, gender and age),, while for the second rowkey (Britney), we only have 2 columns (emailAddress and gender) and for the third rowkey (Tori), we have 3 columns, but _2 are different_ than all the other rowkeys (country and hairColor). This column flexibility is an example of the schema-less architecture mentioned earlier. In a relational database, such a scenario could not happen as the data must matcha pre-defined schema or it otherwise will not be loaded into the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns are logically grouped into _column families_. As mentioned earlier, this architecture optimizes the data store for fast retrieval of columns of data, rather than rows of data. Columnar data stores use the concept of _keyspace_, which is similar to a schema in relational models. This keyspace contains all the column families, which then contain rows, which then contain columns. See the below diagram to help visualise this:\n",

    "Columnar data stores are most often utilized when there is a need for a large data model. Because they can store this large data model they are often used as data warehouses. They can also be appropriate when there is a need for running complex queries that for example, filter based on values. This would not be possible with a key-value data store.\n",
