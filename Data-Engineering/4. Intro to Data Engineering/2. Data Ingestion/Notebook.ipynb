    "\n",
    "> Data ingestion is the process of moving data into a software system. It is one of the main steps of a data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data has become a very valuable asset in modern organisations as they become more data-driven. Data ingestion is a critical step in enabling companies to capture and analyse their data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data ingestion typically do the following things:\n",
    "- Consumes raw data from a creation source (such as a mobile app)\n",
    "- Performs processing (such as cleaning the data to remove empty records)\n",
    "- Writes the cleaned data to a target (which could be another tool, a downstream system or a storage location)"

    "## Approaches to Data Ingestion \n",
    "\n",
    "> In industry, two main approaches for data ingestion are commonly used: Batch and Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Batch Ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "> Batch is when data is grouped together over a period of time and then ingested in bulk (on a regularly scheduled or ad-hoc basis)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to process the _entire dataset_ to calculate some metrics, because they depend on both new and historical data. That's one place where batch ingestion can be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other typical examples of batch data ingestion include:\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database migration\n",
    "- A company has an on-premise relational database that is being migrated to the cloud\n",
    "- The database stores all customer and product information\n",
    "- A full data dump followed by a data migration is required to move everything to the new cloud database\n",
    "- This would be done as one large batch data ingestion activity  \n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data ingestion into data lake\n",
    "- A company has data arriving regularly to different folders and database systems which it wants to integrate together\n",
    "- Every night at 9pm, the data engineers run a scheduled job to extract all the data available from each storage location and ingest that data into an HDFS data lake\n",
    "- The data stored in HDFS can then be processed, integrated and transformed at a later stage\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Payroll\n",
    "- Once a month, a bank runs a number of automated batch jobs to ingest payroll data for all of its staff from various data sources such as a timtesheet system or various database tables\n",
    "- This data can then be integrated and used to do monthly payroll calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch data ingestion is the traditional way organisations have performed data ingestion. It's been used for several decades and the tools implementing it are mature.\n"

    "\n",
    "### 2. Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "> Streaming is when data is ingested as soon as it's created from the source\n",
    "\n",
    "Some business use cases require ingesting data as soon as it is produced. There are several reasons for this. For example the source might not able to store data and can only create a single copy of a data point at regular time intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the typical use cases requiring streaming ingestion include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google maps\n",
    "- Location data created from the mobile device must be sent and ingested instantly\n",
    "- This is required to provide accurate location information even if one is driving at high speeds\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self-driving vehicles\n",
    "- Autonomous vehicles have many systems and sensors producing non-stop data\n",
    "- This data must be ingested as it's created to be sent for immediate processing \n",
    "- A few seconds of delay could be life threatening (for example, a car is at an intersection and the traffic light switches to red)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, almost all processing was done in batches - It's pretty easy to write a script that runs every few hours. Streaming however, is considered tougher as it raises new challenges such as having to keep a system running constantly. In the past, tools to ingest and process data as it was produced didn't yet exist. Having said that, batch processing can have it's own strengths in certain use cases, and raise it's own problems when pushed to it's limits. Although streaming is the more modern approach, it's not the right approach to every problem. We will explore this in more detail later."

    "### Comparing Batch and Streaming \n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a spectrum between streaming and batch data ingestion. The more frequently you run the batch ingestion job, the closer you get to streaming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Near the pure batch batch end of the spectrum of data ingestion approaches, there is a technique called _micro-batching_ which is where data is ingested very frequently but not immediately. In micro-batching, data is collected into small groups (batches) before the data is ingestion into a system. An example of this type of data ingestion is to send airline check-in data every 5 minutes to a mainframe computer. This approach has been commonly used in situations where batching can be used but where lower response times are required and there is no need to ingest a full historical dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how we can visualise a micro-batch of data which will ben sent to the mainframe every 5 minutes:\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've discussed at a high-level the different tools and frameworks available to ingest data in batch and streaming, it's important to understand the similarities and differences between each approach and also to clarify when to use each one.\n",

    "- There are 2 main approaches to data ingestion: streaming and batch. The approaches differ based on how fast data is ingested. In streaming, data ingestion is almost instant, while in batch data is collected over a period of time and then ingested all together in one big bulk (batch).\n",

These include using automated ingestion workflows, scrubbing sensitive data early, using compatible tools/technologies and providing future flexibility regarding new file formats."
