through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. this provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.

it’s been going well, too. since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the uk’s fastest growing target audience companies. we’re not about to stop growing any time soon. as a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.

imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. we’d get a very nuanced view of the world. and we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.

although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. in fact, the gwi office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. this is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

who we are

gwi was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. when you know who you’re speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.

through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. this provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.

it’s been going well, too. since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the uk’s fastest growing target audience companies. we’re not about to stop growing any time soon. as a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.

diversity & inclusion

imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. we’d get a very nuanced view of the world. and we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.

although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. in fact, the gwi office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way. this is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark",data-analyst
