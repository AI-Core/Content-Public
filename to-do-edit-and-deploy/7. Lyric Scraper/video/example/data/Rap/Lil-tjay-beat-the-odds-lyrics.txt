[Chorus]
Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lookin' out tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown
Far out on that water, Father, don't let me drown
I can hear my grandma sayin', "Don't let me down"
People wanna kill me, always keep my gun 'round
Pray I squeeze first, I can't lose the millies I found

[Verse 1]
Bussin' off the stoinky wishin' I was off a bean, no stalk
I was hungry for that money like a fiend
Too deep in that water, my life ain't have no order
Melodic blue stories, I'm feelin' like Baby Keem

I do my own thing, fuck it, I took seven shots, no shame

Back to wall, I'm still gon' blow you down, I ain't no stain
Flow on Wayne, I don't give a fuck about no ceiling

'Cause we catch a opp and send him to the sky (Doot)
They be like, "Tjay, why do you move around with all them fuckin' guns?"
I just tell 'em that's 'cause I don't wanna die
And trust me, I don't lie, can't fuck up, I'm a star right now
If I wasn't quick to blow, I would be in the stars right now

[Chorus]
Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lookin' out tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown
Far out on that water, Father, don't let me drown
I can hear my grandma sayin', "Don't let me down"
People wanna kill me, always keep my gun 'round
Pray I squeeze first, I can't lose the millies I found

[Verse 2]
Shittin' on these niggas be my hobby
I know they mad wishin' they had finished me entirely
Shassa with me, lil' bro say he tryna catch a body
Seen bullets hit a opp, before he died, his face said, "Why me?"
How the fuck I'm livin'? All these niggas wan' fry me
One day they'll stop overlookin' my gift, that's wallahi
Millies in my bank account, but still ain't nothin' jolly
These niggas back and forth tryna pop up like a ollie
You heard they killed who? Drugs talkin', sound like molly
Can someone tell the vlogs, "Get off of my D"?
Never had no doubt if I'm gon' make it or no probably
'Cause I ain't Dummy, Rah, U.E, or Woo Lotti


[Chorus]
Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lookin' out tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown
Far out on that water, Father, don't let me drown
I can hear my grandma sayin', "Don't let me down"
People wanna kill me, always keep my gun 'round
Pray I squeeze first, I can't lose the millies I found
