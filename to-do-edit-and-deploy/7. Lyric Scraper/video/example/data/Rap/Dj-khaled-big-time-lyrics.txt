[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
Rainbow Audemar
, 'cause my bitch bisexual
(We The Best Music)
Posters in the projects, lotta foreign cars
(God Did, DJ Khaled)

[Chorus: Future]
Rainbow Audemar, bitch, I'm big time
Twenty-four hour security guard, bitch, I'm big time
I got more than one main bitch, 'cause I'm big time
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time

[Post-Chorus: Future]
I just left my video, the feds was watchin'
Posted in the hood, they sent the helicopter
Bad bitch on call, got my money right

[Verse 1: Future & DJ Khaled]
Just left from Booby Trap, had a money fight
It don't make sense, it don't make dollars (Don't make dollars)
A different breed, I'm far from normal (Far from normal)
I'm takin' a check and flippin' it, like I know gymnastics
Can't post my dawgs on IG, because they too active
Level up, level up, ain't never gon' stop
Level up, level up (Listen)
Pink floors, I wouldn't be nothin' without this trappin' shit
Yeah, I even gave a bitch a facelift

[Chorus: Future]
Rainbow Audemar, bitch, I'm big time
Twenty-four hour security guard, bitch, I'm big time
I got more than one main bitch, 'cause I'm big time
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time

[Post-Chorus: Future]
I just left my video, the feds was watchin'
Posted in the hood, they sent the helicopter
Bad bitch on call, got my money right
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time
