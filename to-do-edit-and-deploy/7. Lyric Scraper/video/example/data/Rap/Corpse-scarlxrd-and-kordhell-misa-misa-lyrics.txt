[Verse 1: CORPSE & Scarlxrd]
Freak bitch, double fist my dick, uh
Gimme' face, then keep it zipped, uh
Keep her, she keep secrets, uh
Everybody always wanna leak shit, uh

Came up and they don't like it, uh
Should get inspirеd, bitch, uh
New Rick's, don't cry on them (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Scarlxrd & CORPSE]
CORPSE got е-girls fuckin' with me

She on top and my mouth open tryna' catch a titty (Bitch)
My dick on the inside of her guts, I stretch the kitty (Bitch)
Tear my mask, gon' try to taste the pussy if it sticky (Bitch)
I'm a dog but CORPSE just got these cat girls fuckin' with me

Inbox lookin' freaky, nah, bitch, you can't see me (Yeah)
