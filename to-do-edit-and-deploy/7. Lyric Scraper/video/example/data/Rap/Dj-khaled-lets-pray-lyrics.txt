[Verse 1: Don Toliver]
Keep me up, keep me up, I spy plenty of 'em
I, the biggest in your league and your milennium
I was stackin’ up my chips so I got plenty of 'em
I was blowin' ’xotic, catch my equilibrium
Who want the smoke? (Who want the smoke?) Bet' not choke (Bet' not choke)
I made an oath (I made an oath) to keep it afloat (To keep it afloat)
We made a toast (We made a toast), doin' the most (Doin' the most)
To doin' the most (Doin' the most), doin' the most (Doin’ the most)
Need to run it back, we need to run it back
Somеbody hold my back ’cause I'm comin’ in full attack
We need to run it back, we need to run it back (Yеah)
Somebody hold my back 'cause I'm comin' in full attack (Yeah)

[Chorus: Don Toliver & DJ Khaled]
Please come for me, ain’t nobody on this level
At least you had to know it, but you end up callin' the devil (Let's pray)
I know you pray to God when you want something from me
I know you pray to God when you want something from me
I know you pray to God when you want some—

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I smell the smoke (Yeah, I smell)
Bumpin' U-T-O (U-T-O)
Down the P-I-A, all these G-I-As

You know I love to tote, keep that pay O-D role
And when Flame need to spark, she pull up that head
Dumb movin', though that whip, she is smart (Whip it)
Side, keep her head start (It's lit)
Side, bounce on the top
You know they prayin' that you drop, you know I'm prayin' that you not (No)
And never pray for the knots (No)
You know that come with the spot, you know that come when you're hot
Don't get caught dancin' with the devil, don't leave out with the fire (Fire)
Just did this party for some mems who like to one-up the ride
We make the block bleed like a menstrual, who we pull out and slide?
Back to Utopia, the ride
I'll be back when I— uh (Straight up)

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Please come for me, ain't nobody on this level
At least you had to know it, but you end up callin' the devil (Let's pray)
I know you pray to God when you want something from me
I know you pray to God when you want something from me
I know you pray to God when you want some—
