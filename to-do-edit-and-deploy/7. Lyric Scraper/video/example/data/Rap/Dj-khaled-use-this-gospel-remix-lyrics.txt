Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Use this gospel for protection
It's a hard road to Heaven
We call on Your blessings
In the Father, we put our faith
King of the Kingdom
Our demons are tremblin'
Holy angels defendin'
In the Father, we put our faith

Coast Contra â€œNever Freestyle' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified










[Verse: Eminem]
I'm holding on (Yeah) but I don't know if I can take it much longer
Today's the day that I put all of my trust and faith in You, Father
Please let this hate make me stronger

'Fore they turn on me like a zombie
It's like I'm being strangled unconscious (Yeah)
When temptation is almost like Satan is making you tryna
Take you away from your daughters

Danglin' a bunch of painkillers on ya
Wavin' 'em in your face and then watch 'em comin' extra strength
And that's why they make 'em in rectangular objects
'Cause that's the shape of a coffin

Though, it ain't medication this time
But the devil's egging me on
And I ain't gonna let 'em break me 'cause I'm a soldier

You can bank on that promise like the Chamber of Commerce
So my savior, I call on
To rescue me from these depths of despair
So these demons better step like a stair
Because He is my shepherd

I'm armed with Jesus, my weapon is prayer
Soon as I squeeze it, I'm blessed like sneezes

Call me Yeezus, I'm F'd in the head, maybe I'm bonkers

Regardless, never claimed to be flawless
Long as the mistakes I've acknowledged

Y'all wish I would say something positive
Well, okay, then I'm positive
They'd rather trade weather with Mayweather
'Cause they would fare way better with them odds
Than they would exchanging some bars
Or trading any bars with Shady and probably is painfully obviou
s
To compare Godliness to an atheist
But I got them audiences raving (Woo) in amidst my squabbles
I got some awesome inspiration to drop 'em, off 'em
Pen and paper, I'm knockin' 'em off
Woke up on stage at a concert
Whole place looking like a mosh pit

Bible at my side like a rifle with a God-given gift
Every single day I thank God for
That's why I pay so much homage
Praises to Jesus, I'll always
