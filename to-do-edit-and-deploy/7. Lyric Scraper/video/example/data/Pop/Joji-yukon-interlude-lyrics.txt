[Intro]

And my eyes get low in that all-white truck, I can barely see shit

And my eyes get low in that all-white truck, I can barely see
(Girl, I might be)

[Verse]
And I overflow like mercury
Glowing with uncertainty (Glowing with uncertainty)

Circles at the Chevron (Girl, I might be)

I might be forever gone (Bitch, I might be gone)
And my eyes get low in that all-white truck, I can barely see shit
Hit the gas like you wouldn't believe it
Thank God I was always healing
In a time so slow, I was thinking 'bout us rearranging pieces
Speeding up on that all-black Demon
Going west, I don't got no reasons
I was throwing stones at Hercules
Throwing them so perfectly

Circles at the Chevron
I can't be forever young

[Outro]
Empty choir, operated from above
My voice will be their voice until I'm free
My hands will be their hands until I'm free
