(Halloween)
(Halloween)

[Verse 1: Matt Bellamy]
You got me checking my mirror

You make me feel like I'm on the run
Where'd you hide the gun?
The kitchen knife in your hand
Are you the poison? Are you the cure?

I'm not so sure

[Pre-Chorus 1: Matt Bellamy]
I'm shackled, there is no way out
I can't escape

[Chorus 1: Matt Bellamy]
When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
When you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)

[Verse 2: Matt Bellamy & Elle Evans]
You cut me off from my friends
You cut me off from my family

I'm in misery (I'm your number one fan)

Each day, I fall to my knees
I see the writing is on the wall
Now I'm in withdrawal

[Pre-Chorus 2: Matt Bellamy]
I'm shackled, there is no way out
(There is nothing I can do to escape)
I can't escape


[Chorus 1: Matt Bellamy]
When you turn out the lights
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
The way you skulk 'round the house
You make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)
It's Halloween (Halloween)
