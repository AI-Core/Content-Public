[Verse 1: Papa Nihil]
We were speeding together down the dark avenues
But besides all the stardom, all we got was blues

But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go

We were scanning the cities, rocking to pay their dues
But besides all the glamour, all we got was bruised

But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go


[Chorus: Papa Nihil]
You go down just like Holy Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

Not just another bloody Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

[Verse 2: Papa Nihil]
We were searching for reasons to play by the rules
But we quickly found out it was just for fools

Now through all the sorrow, we'll be riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go


[Pre-Chorus: Papa Nihil]
You go down just like Holy Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

Not just another bloody Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a...


[Chorus: Papa Nihil]
You go down just like Holy Mary,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

Your beauty never ever scared me,
Mary on a, Mary on a cross

If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that


[Outro: Papa Nihil]
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross) Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross) Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
(Mary on a) Mary on a cross
