[Verse 1]
It doesn't hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna feel how it feels? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm makin'? (Yeah, yeah, yo)


[Pre-Chorus]
You
It's you and me

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin'
Say, if I only could, oh

[Verse 2]
You don't wanna hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Yeah, yeah, yo)


[Pre-Chorus]
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin' (Yo)
Say, if I only could, oh


[Post-Chorus]
You (Yeah, yeah, yo)
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Yeah, yeah, yo)
