[Verse 1]
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend

And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on

But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone


[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die

When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars

Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free

But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me


[Verse 4]
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine

I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line

Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay

And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
