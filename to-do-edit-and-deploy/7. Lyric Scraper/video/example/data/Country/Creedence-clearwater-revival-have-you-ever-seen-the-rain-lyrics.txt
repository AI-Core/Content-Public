[Verse 1]
Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm

I know, it's been comin' for some time

When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water


[Chorus]
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time

'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder


[Chorus]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day


Yeah!

[Chorus]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
