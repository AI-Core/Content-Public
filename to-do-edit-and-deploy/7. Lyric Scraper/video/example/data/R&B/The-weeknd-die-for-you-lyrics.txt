[Verse 1]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah


[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry

You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night

I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love

I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

[Chorus]

Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Say)


[Verse 2]
I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever

And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe


[Pre-Chorus]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry

It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
