What you, ooh, uh, what you do?
Made a move, coulda made a move

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit

Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me (I wish I knew)
I wish I knew (Oh), I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Yeah), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me


[Verse 2: Steve Lacy]
Please say to me (Please, just say to me)
If you still wanna
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (Oh, no)

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Uh, can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?

Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
No, you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah
