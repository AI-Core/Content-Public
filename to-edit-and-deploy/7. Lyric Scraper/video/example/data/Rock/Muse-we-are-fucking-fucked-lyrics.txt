[Intro]
(We play it together)

[Verse 1]
You really believe
We can survive all of this?
The black vacuum of the universe, it was designed
To swallow us whole
It's a losing game

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We're at death's door, another world war

Wildfires
and earthquakes I foresaw
A life in crisis
, a deadly virus

Tsunamis of hate are gonna find us
00:00/15:19

[Chorus]
Ah
We are fucking fucked
Ah
We are fucking fucked

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're at death's door, another world war

Wildfires
and earthquakes I foresaw
A life in crisis
, mutated virus

Tsunamis of hate are gonna drown us

[Chorus]
Ah
We are fucking fucked
Ah
We are fucking fucked

[Verse 2]
True, just when you think
You are safe and secure
You'll forget what you need to remember, living in peace
But you're living a lie
The game is rigged

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're at death's door, another world war

Wildfires
and earthquakes I foresaw
A life in crisis
, mutated virus

Tsunamis of hate are gonna drown us
