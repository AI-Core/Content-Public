[Verse 1]
Now and then
My mind drifts to a place where I find you
Lost in my head
There are unsolved feelings that haunt me
It's too late to heal, I'll lay them to rest

[Chorus 1]
How can I move on
When everyone I see still talks about you?
How can I move on
When all the best things I have we made together?
Here's to letting go
But I am lost in a void with your ghost and our memories
Lest we forget
The great reset

[Verse 2]
If I could bring you back
There are truths and confessions I'd tell you
I'd set things straight
And I believe that you would love and forgive me
I know it's too late, I need to let go

[Chorus 2]
And how can I move on
When everyone I see still talks about you?
How can I move on
When all the best things I have we built together?
Here's to letting go
But I am trapped in a void with your ghost and our memories
Lest we forget
The great reset


[Bridge]
How can I sleep with this coldness beside me?
How can I sleep with this coldness inside me?
I know I can't bring back your love

[Chorus]
How can I move on
When everyone I see still talks about you?
How can I move on
When all the best things I have were made together?
Here's to letting go
But I am lost in a void with your ghost and our memories
Lest we forget
The great reset
