[Intro: DJ Khaled]
It breaks my heart
They ain't believe in us
We the Best Music
They played themselves
While you hatin' and being jealous
You could be over here embracing that love
More love, more blessings, more life
GOD DID (GOD DID)
You either win with us or you watch us win
DJ Khaled

[Pre-Chorus: Fridayy & Rick Ross]
They wanted us down, ooh-woah
But look at us now, oh
They counted us out (Time to say a prayer, M-M-M—)
They didn't think that we would make it, oh (May we bow our heads)
They didn't believe in us, oh (Huh)

[Chorus: Fridayy & Rick Ross]
But I know God did, God did (Oh, yes, He did)
Oh, God did (Oh-oh, Khaled)
Oh, yes, God did (Oh-oh, Khaled)
Oh, God did (God is great)
But I know God did

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Nosedive, they just prayin' that I crash (Huh)
Those guys, they don't wanna see you last
They'll jack up three million dollars up on your tax
A tub full of money, I still can't relax
Tires spinnin', Lord forgive me, I'm a sinner
Conquer, divide niggas

Wrong side of the petition, only divine winnin'
Better listen when I tell you how I put time in it
Please, forgive me, God did

So leave me in the dark, swimmin' with the sharks
Dope boy, big calm, still the biggest boss
Got a kilo on a plate, send 'em on a freight
Or I can go and buy a bank, I know my money's safe (Maybach Music)
