[Part I]

[Intro: The Last Poets]
Radar, sonar, laser beams
Jets, tanks, submarines
Megathons, H-bombs, napalm, ga—

[Verse 1]
I got the shit you would light with a lighter
Fuck a lighter, I could light on the stove
Dark at night, I'll drop a log on the fire
Wander in the woods out in the cold
I got the shit you could play for your mama
I got the shit you could play for the hoes
I got the shit you could sell to the trappers
In Decatur with the 'K and the Colt
I know some rappers that—how I'ma say this?
I know some rappers who paid but broke
Lotta money but you played your soul
You played yourself, you played the role
I know some niggas from down the street
Some of my niggas been down the road
Lost a nigga that was down with me
You know what they say, it rains, it pours
00:00/15:19

Coast Contra “Never Freestyle' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified










[Chorus]
It rains, it pours
(Ooh, we have a penalty flag thrown at the thirty yard line)
(Personal foul, unsportsman-like conduct, number six on the defense, fifty-) It rains, it pours
It rains, it pours

[Verse 2]
They got the shit they could pull out
I know it could blow out a back, yeah
They got the cure to the vax'
Facts, you know where it's at
They put the money, the crack in a sack
They got the axis, they got the Atlas, they got the maps
I got a real, real, real bad bitch
I just told her to come to the back (Oh man)
They got the people in office
Them crackers that had us in chains
They make the laws, they goin' hard
Dang, they even started a gang
How you gon' win in a losable game?
Make a change, man, niggas say the same thing
Every day, complain and the sun shine
And the cloud rain, but won't lift a finger
In the danger, niggas been endangered
Been indentured, now my niggas got business ventures
With my .9, I'm like ten Avengers
Snap a finger, I could end adventures

Rapper? Singer? No, killer, nigga
You a cop or you a nigga killer, woah
