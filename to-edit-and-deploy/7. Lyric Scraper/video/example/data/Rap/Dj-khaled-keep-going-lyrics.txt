DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
He a bitch, he runnin', he screamin' for help, we gon' get him as soon as he tired (Yeah)
I seen bitches get over they feelings for niggas some hours after he died
Half the city be bap, the niggas who rap be cap, the niggas be lyin'
I told bro'nem, "On foenem (Yeah), the feds bе watchin' the live" (Foenеm)
And I'm pushin' P, beefin' with my Drac', I'm Pusha T

I go to Phlavz when I'm in Chicago, my brother the owner, I'm eatin' for free

I brought a million in cash around, so stop tellin' niggas you bigger than me (Bigger than me)
I'm gettin' money, he gettin' money, feel like Big Meech and Southwest T (Man, what?)

I'm with Khaled Khaled, throw your hood up, bitch, you 'bout it, 'bout it (Throw your hood up)

Need that 'Rari truck, put me on that list, I gotta have it
And I wanna see Cardi and Nicki (What else?)
In the city, I ride with my blicky (What else?)
How you mad she be poppin' her titties? (What else?)
How you mad I pop prescription? (What else?)
How you mad I'm on the block with gremlins? (What else?)
War time, don't sit by the window (What else?)
This a Patek, this not a Cartier, time is different

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch, Lil Durk & DJ Khaled]
Man, what? (Man, what? Man, what?)
Keep goin' (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

This a wide body, these ain't stocks though
He ain't 'bout it, 'bout it, where your chop' go?
In a opp party, you did not go
He spinnin', spinnin', spinnin', spinnin' on repeat
He spinnin', spinnin', spinnin', spinnin', can't even breathe, ayy
We on the streets, better call on G-O-D, ayy
This a wide body, these ain't stocks though
He ain't 'bout it, 'bout it, where your chop' go?
In a opp party, you did not go
He spinnin', spinnin', spinnin', spinnin' on repeat

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Woah, Rari' squat low to the flow, wake up, hustle all I know
Rolex cost a hundred times four
I'm from the bottom, I used to be poor
Half a milli', you want me to choke
My car haunted, I'm driving a Ghost

I told the chauffeur pick up a ho, she like, "Bae I can't open the door"
Too much smoke, the bulletproof the only car I slide in
Movin' casket, bought a 'Cat and that's the car he died in (21)
Court system in my bedroom, only place I lied in (21)
I took a Hollywood bitch to Starlight and I got head at the drive-in (21)

Chop a nigga block like a tight end (Straight up)
Say you a stepper, who died then? (Pussy)
Niggas in the middle get boxed in (21)
We don't cry 'bout it, we go spin (21)
Pateks ain't shit, I got ten (21)
I make money, I don't make friends (21)
Can't get with it, they'll hate then (21)
Everybody G.O.A.T.s, I'm an ape then (21)
You the type to walk up, cray sayin' (21)
I'ma buy a house with the lake then (21)
You wanna save these thot hoes (21)
You can get put on a cape then (21)
