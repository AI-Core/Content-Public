[Verse 1]

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah

Milli point two just to hurt you, ah

All red Lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah

Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]

House so empty, need a centerpiece

Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah

You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain


[Chorus]
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what you've done
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what you've done
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy


[Verse 2]
Every day, a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day, a nigga try to end me, ah

Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah

Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I

The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition
