[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?

I'm on your magical mystery ride

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright


[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

Coast Contra â€œNever Freestyle' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified










[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning


[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh


[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood

You're my downfall, you're my muse

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you


[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
