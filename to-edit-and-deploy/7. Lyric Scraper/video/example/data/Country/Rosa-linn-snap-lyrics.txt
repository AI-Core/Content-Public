[Verse 1]
It's 4 AM
I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They say, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

[Bridge]
I just need time
00:00/15:19

Coast Contra â€œNever Freestyle' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified










[Chorus]
Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

[Verse 2]
I'm writin' a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I was spendin' my nights in the rain, tryna put it out


[Chorus]
So I'm snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
