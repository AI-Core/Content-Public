[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town

And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
