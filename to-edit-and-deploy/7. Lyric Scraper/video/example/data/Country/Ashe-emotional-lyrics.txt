[Intro]
(One, two, three, go)

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna run you over heavy on the gas
I'm a million miles an hour and I'm never coming last
Hey, hey-hey
Saw you in the distance, there was something in the room
Could've been the music or it could've been the moon
Hey, hey-hey

You don't have to stay the night, only if you want
I'm a little dark side, I'm a little fun
Hey, hey-hey
Used to like the drama, baby, I don't anymore
If you got some trouble, baby, leave it at the door
Hey, hey-hey (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
