## Classification Project

For this project you will be applying supervised learning to solve a classification problem based on your own data. You will identify an **industry relevant** prediction problem, develop a solution and them present the results.

This project will use the same dataset from the previous regression project, which your previously collected, preprocessed and cleaned. There is no need to cover the data collection, cleaning or preprocessing steps in this project. Instead the focus will be on the feature engineering, modelling, evaluation and interpretation of results. You are expected to do a large search over models and features to find the best solution reasonably attainable.

Notes: 
- Focus on your process, not the model performance. This is how your project will be evaluated. Some problems are just really difficult to crack and don't give you great results.

## Deliverables

1. Github repo containing all code
2. Presentation

    Your presentation should be split into two parts:

    1. Non-technical presentation
    This part should highlight the problem and the solution at a high level. It should explain the results that were attained and how they will drive business value.
    2. Technical presentation
    Should go into detail of what techniques you applied, basically stepping through each of the points in the Data & Modelling parts of the mark scheme

See below for more details

## Mark scheme

Each of the following bullets will be marked as 0 (not attempted), 1 (attempted) and 2 (completed)

### Planning
- Stakeholders identified
- Realistic industry problem identified
- Measure of success defined

### Feature engineering
- Evaluated feature importance using standard procedures like iterative Lasso regularisation
- Random seed applied for repeatability

### Modelling
- Evaluation of different models 
- Establish and clearly highlight a baseline using a simple model 
- Several models fit to data
- Relevant evaluation metrics identified
- Experiment parameters recorded and logged
- Model evaluated for overfitting and underfitting
- Regularisation applied
- Hyperparameter search implemented
- Justified choice of hyperparameters
- Performance evaluated on test set
- Saved best model in appropriate format
- Feature selection and engineering
  - Identified most important features
  - Identified least important features tested results after removing
  - Computed several custom features and described reasons for computing them

### Repo/code
  - 30+ commits
  - good commit messages
  - work done on several branches and merged
  - does not contain anything unnecessary
  - object oriented code
  - every function and class has a docstring
  - where the point of code is not obvious, it should be commented
  - contains presentation
  - cumbersome code moved out of notebook and into .py files
  - model parameter tuning is done in a jupyter notebook, and imports code from .py files
  - No error or warning messages are shown in the notebook
  - Repo structure should make it easy to navigate (and develop)
  - All Jupyter notebook/s cells are run and show their output (which should be trimmed if too long)
- README
  - describes project brief
  - describes data
  - contains visual elements
  - markdown formatting used abundantly to improve readability (headings, bullets, callouts, code cells)
  - shows results
  - contains "Usage" section

### Presentation
- Contains both non-technical and technical sections with a clear transition
- Lasts no more than 7 minutes
- Act professionally
- Treated the audience as your identified stakeholder for each section
- Focus on the important parts
- Good pace
- Non-technical section
  - explains problem statement
  - explains solution
  - explains results in context of problem
  - no jargon
  - explains how the solution will be used in practice - how will I interact with it?
- Technical section
  - Talks through each of the Data and Modelling sections of the mark scheme detailed above
  - Highlights limitations, concerns and ideas to improve
- Give a clear ending and summary
