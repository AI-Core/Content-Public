    "\n",
    "A machine learning algorithm is one which is able to learn from data to increase it's performance at some task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at tasks in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.\" - [Tom Mitchell](http://profsite.um.ac.ir/~monsefi/machine-learning/pdf/Machine-Learning-Tom-Mitchell.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The task, T\n",
    "\n",
    "- regression - predicting a continuous output\n",
    "- classification - predicting output being in one of multiple classes\n",
    "- clustering - grouping sets of examples together\n",
    "- lots of others (some of which we might later see)\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"predicting\" very well describes the formulation of all of these examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The task can always be framed as solving a prediction problem, where we have some input and want to predict some output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we will be letting our computers do all of the hard work, our inputs and outputs must be represented numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once we have numerical inputs and outputs, we can write mathematical functions that perform this input-output mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the bulk of this chapter will be focused on different types of functions, their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim will be to not rigidly define these functions ourself, but to allow our machines to find the transformation to be applied to the input in order to product\n",

    "![](images/inp-out.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The performance, P\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a task, we need to be able to measure how well we are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> There are many ways of doing this, and the one you should choose often depends on the context of what problem you are trying to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of performance measures:\n",
    "- accuracy - how many predictions were correct\n",
    "- squared error - how far off our continuous predictions are\n",
    "\n",
    "These performance metrics are easy to evaluate, but in reality they may not convert into the results that you really want. \n",

    "We will talk more about performance measurements in a few notebooks\n",
