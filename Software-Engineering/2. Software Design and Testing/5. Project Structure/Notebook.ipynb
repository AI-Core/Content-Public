They allow you to create professional README files!_\n",
    "- `LICENSE`: This text describes the license that you are using for the project. If you are distributing a project, it is a good idea to add one. `GitHub` has shortcuts to add them to your repo, but if you are unsure of which one you should use, check this [page](https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/) or this [one](https://choosealicense.com)\n",
