[Intro]
Can we kiss with poison on our lips?
Well, I'm not scared


[Verse 1]
Can we touch and taste forbidden bliss?

They can't stop us now, I won't let you be alone
I am coming for you
Keep us apart
, it's too much to ask


[Verse 2]
We're running away
Take off your clothes and take off your mask

It's not over now, I won't leave you in the dark
Because I need you so

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 1]
Can we kiss, contagion on our lips?

Well, I don't care
We can touch and feel forbidden bliss

They can't stop us now, I won't let you feel alone

Because I need you so

[Interlude]
(Ho-oh)
(Ho-oh)

[Verse 3]
You and me throw caution to the wind
And I will risk everything just to feel
The warmth and the voltage of your skin
If this is my last day on Earth, I just want to be with you
You are all that's true

[Chorus 2]
We will kiss with poison on our lips
Well, I'm not scared

We will touch and reach forbidden bliss

They can't stop us now, I won't let you die alone
Because I love you so
