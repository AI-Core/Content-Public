[Verse 1]
I'll remember you this way
Keep you safe inside my memory

But I’ve held you here for far too long

I wonder if you think of me

I'm still putting up a fight

While you're off and you’re forgetting me

Never got the chance to tell our story
A tale as old as time


[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you go?
Is it something I said? (Something I said)

Why am I alone in this bed?

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me

Why can't I see?
No, it can't be this easy
To let me go
But if you say so

Guess I make love too dangerous


[Verse 2]
Right when I think I hate you
Something pulls me under like the tide

Even picked a house and chose our kids' names
You'd always be mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you go?
Is it something I said?
(Something I said)
Why am I alone in this bed?


[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me

Why can't I see?
No, it can't be this easy
To let me go
But if you say so

Guess I make love too dangerous
