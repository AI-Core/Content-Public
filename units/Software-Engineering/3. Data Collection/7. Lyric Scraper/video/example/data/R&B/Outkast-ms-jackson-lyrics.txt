[Intro: André 3000]
Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this


[Chorus: André 3000]

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Big Boi
]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me

She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out

That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that

I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down

She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down

She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided

She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited

Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah


[Chorus: André 3000]

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
