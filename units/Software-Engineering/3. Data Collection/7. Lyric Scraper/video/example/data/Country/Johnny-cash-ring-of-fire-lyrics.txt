[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire


[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire


[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet

I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
