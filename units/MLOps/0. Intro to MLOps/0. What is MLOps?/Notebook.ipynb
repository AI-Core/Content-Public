    "MLOps is still in its infancy, and we expect the definition to evolve. Every tool used in the ML stack _could_ in theory be considered an MLOps tool, in the sense that they streamline ML system development by (hopefully) making it easier. Currently, MLOps tools refer to those which make it easier for you to more quickly iterate through the ML model lifecycle, particularly after the model is put into production.\n",

    "- __Feature stores__ are a single place to store features that might be used across teams, but could be costly to compute, like the average purchase size this year \n",
    "- __Model registry__, like MLFlow's, allow you to move models into and out of production with a simple dropdown menu \n",
    "- __Data versioning__ tools like DVC help you to repeat experiments and track what worked best for different data as it constantly evolves\n",

    "1. Faster project delivery\n",
    "    - Quicker handovers between teams\n",

    "    - Repeatability - Everyone has a common language, and uses the same ground truth sources for things like data, features, models etc.\n",

    "    - When you implement MLOps processes, data scientists can focus on the data science\n",

    "    - In other companies, data scientists \"throw the model over the wall\" to the ML engineers who deploy them by just sending them a jupyter notebook. You can't put jupyter notebooks into production, and some ML engineers have described their job as \"starting from scratch\" once the data scientist has developed a proof of concept. What a waste of time! By defining a process and a specification for these teams to interact, the whole "
