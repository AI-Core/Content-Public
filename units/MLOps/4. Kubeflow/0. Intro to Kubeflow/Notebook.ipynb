    "> __Kubeflow is an abstraction layer over `k8s` which enables easier `ML` oriented workflows__\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to `k8s` it is:\n",
    "- more Python centric\n",
    "- uses other cluster-specific projects like [`istio`](https://github.com/istio/istio)\n",
    "- leverages `Service`s out of the box and is all about micro-services defined with `Pipelines` (described later)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can I use it for?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimentation and hyper-parameter tuning via [`katib`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/) (way faster due to parallelization across cluster)\n",
    "- Deploying and managing complex ML tasks at scale ([`kfserving`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/kfserving/))\n",
    "- Monitoring our application (or ease of addition of respective components)\n",
    "- `CI/CD` is not officially supported, although it can be quite easily mixed with popular solutions like `GH-Actions`, `Jenkins` or a-like\n",

    "\n",
    "- [Central Dashboard](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/) - visualize `pipeline`s, resource usage and other relevant statistics with easy to use `UI`\n",
    "- [Notebook Servers](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/notebooks/) - `jupyter notebook`s provided as a mean for experimentation, data visualization or exploration\n",
    "- [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/) - high level DAG which allows us to specify necessary steps for deployment/training/tuning/CI etc.\n",
    "- [KFServing](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/kfserving/) - similar idea to `tensorflow`'s `Serving` \n",
    "- [Katib](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/) - hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- [Training Operators](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/) - operators used to `train` specific frameworks (__mostly `DL` oriented__) to downstream common tasks\n",
    "- [Multi-Tenancy](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/) - IAM and isolation, security related and sharing resources across teams"

    "3. __`service mesh` - network of such services working together__\n",
    "4. __It is getting progressively harder to manage such stack__\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where `istio` comes in, which, after being added allows us to:\n",
    "- Add observability for our services (e.g. gathering metrics)\n",
    "- Provides `load-balancing`, failure recovery and metrics __via simple `.yaml` configuration__\n",

    "- Python SDK - user defined `pipeline` using `dsl`. __This `dsl` is transpiled to `k8s` readable `.yaml` files__\n",
    "- __Pipeline webserver__ - gathers data from `Service`s with help of [`istio`](https://istio.io/)'s service mesh\n",

    "    - `Argo` is the core controller (see [here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/)); __allows us to schedule complicated pipelines with dependencies__\n",

    "    - `metadata` - stored in a `mysql` database used as `PersistentVolume`\n",

    "# Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mandatory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Check how to create custom `Component` WITHOUT `python function`__ (e.g. as a standalone program with custom `Dockerfile` and `yaml` specification) [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/component-development/). This approach allows us for:\n",
    "    - Easier customization of `Dockerfile` (although one can almost always deploy `image` beforehand and use it from within `python`)\n",
    "    - Custom `.yaml` file - this one is harder to obtain with `python` functions (e.g. dependent values on `envvars` etc.)\n",
    "    - __Make sure you have read and understood this part!__\n",
    "- Check what is required to use `recursion` with `kubeflow`'s `dsl` [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/dsl-recursion/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check out [`sidecar injection`](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2019/data-plane-setup/) pattern (used by `istio`). What is it, why is it useful?\n",
    "- Check out [`kubeflow-kale`](https://github.com/kubeflow-kale/kale) as an even simpler way to define `kubeflow` pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DSL\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through [`kfp.dsl`](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kfp.dsl.html) documentation. What others methods could you use to the define the `pipeline`? Check out [parallel loop](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/kfp.dsl.html#kfp.dsl.ParallelFor)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check how to directly manipulate `k8s` objects [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/manipulate-resources/). __It should not be done in general__ and `k8s` objects are better provided more \"statically\", but it is worth knowing one can do this from `kubeflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check how to create `metrics` as a part of `pipeline` or as a `component` [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/pipelines-metrics/). Which option (`pipeline` or `component`) should be preferred? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check out [static type checking](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/static-type-checking/). How could one utilize it for increased robustness of the pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check visualization within `Kubeflow UI` [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/output-viewer/). __You might want to use different way for `visualization`s though as `kubeflow`'s target is a little different__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check out [`min.io`](https://min.io/) for better understanding of the cloud-native and `k8s` first data foramt\n",
    "- Read about basics of [`argoproj`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/) which is used by `kubeflow` to orchestrate workflows\n",
    "- `feast` feature store can be used together with `kubeflow`. Check [relevant documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/feature-store/overview/) __and use it after `feast` was presented by `AiCore` team!__\n",
    "- Check out integrated [tools for serving](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/serving/) (includes `NVidia`'s `Triton` and `bento` project)\n",
    "- Check out [`kubeflow fairing`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/fairing/fairing-overview/) for improved hybrid cloud experience with `ML` (also allows to run/debug our runs locally). In addition, one can easily open an `endpoint` with deployed `model`, hence __worth checking out!__"
