    "Feature Stores are central hubs that (you guessed it) store features. In other words, feature store allows you to transform raw data into feature values, store those values, and use them for (re)training a model or for making predictions. This sounds like a classic database so far, right? But when you're working with lots of data, across lots of teams, new problems can surface which feature stores help address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different teams might be using the same feature name to refer to something slightly different.\n",
    "- Different teams might be computing a feature in a different and potentially incorrect way.\n",
    "- Computed features required by a model might not be available immediately when required to make predictions in production.\n",
    "- Features may be being computed differently and incorrectly between training and serving (deployment).\n",
    "- Features may be being computed differently and incorrectly between development, testing and production.\n",
    "- Different teams might not have access to the central, correct store of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "You might have a huge dataset, and features that you engineered are becoming painfully slow to compute due to the great amount of data to be processed. For example, you might have a useful feature \"Average purchase value\" which, if you have millions of purchases, could take a while to compute this value. Each time you compute a feature you have to process all data; an alternative would be storing a running feature, so next time you add more data, you can access your feature store and grab the feature without processing the whole dataset.\n",

    "# Features - Offline or Online\n",
    "\n",
    "You know by now that a feature is an input variable. However, what is the difference between _Offline_ and _Online_ features?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Offline features__: These are static, historic features that don’t change much, and are processed in batch. Usually, offline features are calculated via frameworks such as Spark or by simply running SQL queries against a given database and then using a batch inference process. These features can be properties like patient age, a transaction location, or an IP address.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Online features__: These features are dynamic and require a processing engine to calculate, sometimes in near-real time. They often need to be served in ultra-low latency. Any feature which is an average over some history, for example, is an online feature. As another example, calculating a z-score for real-time fraud detection. In this case, the pipeline is built by calculating the mean and the standard deviation over a sliding window in real time. These calculations are much more challenging, requiring fast computation as well as fast access to the data. The data can be stored in memory or in a very fast key-value database.\n",
    "\n",
    "An even more complicated type of feature is engineered by using an ML process to generate the feature from a datapoint. An example of this might be to create a “contains a positive product review” feature by using NLP to identify reviews discussing a product in a positive manner."

    "# Feature Store Components\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 main components of a modern feature store: Transformation, Storage, Serving, Monitoring, and feature Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Serving\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature stores serve feature data to models. Those models require a consistent view of features across training and serving. The definitions of features used to train a model must exactly match the features provided in online serving. When they don’t match, training-serving skew is introduced which can cause catastrophic and hard-to-debug model performance problems. This can be caused by different teams calculating features in slightly different ways, or forgetting to normalise data amongst other reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature stores abstract away the logic and processing used to generate a feature, providing users an easy and canonical way to access all features in a company consistently across all environments in which they’re needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When retrieving data offline (i.e. for training), feature values are commonly accessed through notebook-friendly feature store SDKs. They provide point-in-time correct views of the state of the world for each example used to train a model (a.k.a. “time-travel”).\n",
    "For online serving, a feature store delivers a single vector of features at a time made up of the freshest feature values. Responses are served through a high-performance API backed by a low-latency database."

    "\r\n",
    "Feature stores persist feature data to support retrieval through feature serving layers. They typically contain both an online and offline storage layer to support the requirements of different feature serving systems.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Offline storage layers are typically used to store months’ or years’ worth of feature data for training purposes. Offline feature store data is often stored in data warehouses or data lakes like S3, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift. Extending an existing data lake or data warehouse for offline feature storage is typically preferred to prevent data silos.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Online storage layers are used to persist feature values for low-latency lookup during inference. They typically only store the latest feature values for each entity, essentially modeling the current state of the world. Online stores are usually eventually consistent, and do not have strict consistency requirements for most ML use cases. They are usually implemented with key-value stores like DynamoDB, Redis, or Cassandra.\r\n",

When iterating on a model, new features are often engineered to be used in training datasets that correspond to historical events (e.g. all purchases in the past 6 months).

Some feature stores automatically backfill newly registered features for preconfigured time ranges for registered training datasets.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "When running production systems, it’s also important to monitor operational metrics. Feature stores track operational metrics relating to core functionality. E.g. metrics relating to feature storage (availability, capacity, utilization, staleness) or feature serving (throughput, latency, error rates). Other metrics describe the operations of important adjacent system components. For example, operational metrics for external data processing engines (e.g. job success rate, throughput, processing lag and rate).\r\n",

Serving APIs use the registry for a consistent understanding of which feature values should be available, who should be able to access them, and how they should be served.\r\n",

    "# Feature Store Providers\n",

    "- __Feast__: Feast has grown in popularity during the last months, and currently is one of the most used Feature Stores providers. It can be easily used with Python, and the library will handle many file management intricacies. This is a great option if you already created the transformation Pipeline\n",
    "- __Tecton__: Another very popular Feature Store provider is Tecton, which includes end-to-end pipelines for your features. This, as opposed to Feast, it supports transformations.\n",
    "- __AWS__: Amazon doesn't actually provide a stand-alone Feature Store service. Instead, it integrates this service in its SageMaker service.\n",
    "- __Hospworks__: It supports the full stack mentioned in this lesson, and it also includes a nice User Interface. Additionally, it can integrate more third-party services, so you can extend your pipeline easily.\n",
    "- __Iguazio__: This Feature Store has its own platform, and doesn't rely on other platforms to store the features. However, that doesn't mean that you can't use third-party services!\n",
