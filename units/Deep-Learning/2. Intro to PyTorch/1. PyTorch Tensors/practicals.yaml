  name: Tensor Arithmetic
  description: |
    Create two tensors called `a` and `b`, then perform the following arithmetic on them.

    Divide `a` by `b` and store the result in a variable called `div`

    Multiply `a` by `b` and store the result in a variable called `mul`

    Add `a` by `b` and store the result in a variable called `add`
