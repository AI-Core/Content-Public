<!-- MOTIVATION -->

- When you get to the point where you have billions of datapoints, you can't store them in an excel sheet or a python dataframe
- you can't even fit all of them on one machine

<!-- WHAT IS DATA ENGINEERING? -->

- data engineering is moving data from one place to another and storing it scalably and securely

<!-- WHEN COMPANIES NEED DATA ENGINEERS -->

- companies need data engineers when they start having to deal with datasets that are too large to fit in one machine
