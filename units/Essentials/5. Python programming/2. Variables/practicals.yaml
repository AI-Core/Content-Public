    1. Define two variables `num1`, and `num2` with the values 37 and 52 respectively
    2. What is the sum of num1 and num2? What about the product?
    3. Now reassign `num1` and `num2` to have the values 8 and 3 respectively
    4. Reuse the code to determine their sum and product

    Define the the following variables `num = 23`, `text_num = “57”` and `decimal_num = 98.3`
    1. Print the types of each variable (hint: use a type comversion function)
    2. What is the sum of your variables? What datatype is the sum?

  name: Printing Multiple Variables
  description: |+
    You can use the print function to print multiple variables of different types on a single line. 
    This can be done by using comma to separate variables within the parentheses of the print function. 
    For example: `print(variable1, variable2)`. You can also print raw values that have not been assigned variables. 
    For example, `print("This is variable 1: ", 67)`.

    For this exercise, define 5-10 numbers as variables. `num1=...`, `num2=...`
    1. Use a single print statement to print all of the even numbers out of your newly defined variables with the 
    following statement, `"These are my even numbers:"`.
    2. The + operator in Python works with strings variables as well as numeric types - but it simply concatenates 
    strings together one after the other. Using + and the example below, write your output as a single complete 
    sentence. (Hint: you'll probably need to use at least one type conversion function).

    `print("work" + "shop")` will output workshop
    'print("3" + "7")' will output 37

    1. Assign variables for each of these items and their prices
        - Tomatoes cost 87p for a pack of 6
        - 500g sugar costs £1.09
        - Washing sponges cost 29p for a pack of 10
        - Juice is £1.89 per 1.5l bottle
        - Foil is £1.29 per 30m roll
    2. Using arithmetic operations in Python, calculate the price of 1kg sugar
    3. What is the price of 20 washing sponges, 3l of juice, and 2 packs of tomatoes?

    1. How much would it cost for 5 people if each person needs:
       - A pack of tomatoes
       - 3 washing sponges
       - A litre of juice
       - 20m of foil
       - 180g sugar
    2. Assign the value to total
       - Provide your answer as a printed variable called total.
    3. These prices do not include VAT. Calculate the VAT on the total, assuming that VAT is 20%.
    4. Then round it appropriately to two decimal places.
