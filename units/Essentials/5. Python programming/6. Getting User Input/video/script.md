- python's built in input function requests the user type in some input

_Switch to screen capture_

_type input()_

- when you run a program from the terminal, or the integrated terminal, the prompt will flash a cursor where it expects you to wtype the input

_run the program_

- the code stops when it reaches this input and waits for the input

_point to the input line in the code_

- you can then hit enter to submit the input

_hit enter_

- the input function returns whatever was input by the user
- that means that you can assign the input to a variable like this

_Assign input to variable: `user_input = input()`, print the variable, and run the program_

- you can also give the user a prompt, indicating what you want them to input
- the prompt is the first argument to the input function

- if you run a vscode script in interactive mode, then the input field shows at the top of the screen - it can be easy to miss!

_Run script in interactive mode using magic cells_

_Switch to webcam_

- There's been a bunch of times where I've sat there for minutes waiting for a terminal to pop up without realising that the input field is up there

_Switch to screen capture_

_Point to input field at top of screen_

_Switch to webcam_

- so overall, you can use the input function to get input from the user, which is returned from the function, and you can give them a prompt
