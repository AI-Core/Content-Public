<!-- MOTIVATION -->

- sometimes you might want to leave a note, explanation, or a reminder to update or change something in your Python code
- but you can't just write it out, because the python interpreter is going to treat it like code, and run it

<!-- SINGLE LINE COMMENTS -->

- so to indicate to the interpreter that something you've written isn't code, you can simply put the hash symbol before it, on the same line
- we call this a comment

<!-- YOU CAN HAVE LINES WHICH ARE ALL COMMENT -->

- only the characters after the hashtag are treated as a comment
- so you can put comments after code on the same line

<!-- WHAT ARE COMMENTS FOR -->

- explaining how something works
- highlighting what different parts of the code does
- leaving reminders

<!-- TODO COMMENTS -->

- for example, if you leave a TODO comment, you can later search for all of these comments to get an outstanding TODO list

<!-- MULTILINE COMMENTS -->

- You can also leave multiline comments between triple quotes
- just like a single line comment, the interpreter ignores everything in between

<!-- OUTRO -->

- so now you should be able to use comments in your code
