    Create a lambda function for each of the following bullet points:
    - A lambda function that takes in a number and returns that number squared
    - A lambda function that takes in a number and returns that number cubed
    - A lambda function that takes two numbers and returns the sum of those numbers
    - A lambda function that takes two numbers and returns the product of those numbers

  name: Sorting with Lambda Functions
  description: |+
    Create a list with 5 tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a number.
    Then, using the `sort` function, create a lambda function for each of the following bullet points:
    - Sort the list by the number in each tuple
    - Sort the list by the name in each tuple
    - Sort the list by the length of the name in each tuple
    - Sort the list by the length of the name in each tuple, but in reverse order

    Create a list of 5 numbers
    - Create a lambda function that squares a number. Then use `map` to square each number in the list
    - Create a lambda function that cubes a number. Then use `map` to cube each number in the list
    - Create a lambda function that takes in a number and returns that number squared if it is even, and cubed if it is odd. Then use `map` to apply the function to each number in the list

  name: Lambda Functions with Filter
  description: |+
    Create a list of 10 strings
    - Create a lambda function that takes in a string and returns `True` if the string is longer than 5 characters, and `False` if it is not. Then use `filter` and the lambda function to filter out all strings that are longer than 5 characters
    - Create a lambda function that takes in a string and returns `True` if the string is longer than 5 characters and starts with a vowel, and `False` if it is not. Then use `filter` and the lambda function to filter out all strings that are longer than 5 characters and start with a vowel
