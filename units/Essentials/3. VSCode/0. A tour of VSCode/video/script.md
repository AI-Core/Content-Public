- VSCode is the industry standard development environment
- it's where you should be writing all of your code

<!-- INSTALLING -->

- you can install it online
- just search for download vscode
- select the version that applies to your machine
- and run the installer after it has downloaded
- then you should be able to find the application

<!-- OPEN FOLDER -->

- when you open it, it will look like this

_show new vscode window using `CMD+SHIFT+N`_

<!-- THE FILE EXPLORER -->

- you can see all of the files from the file explorer, which is the top left icon
- by default it won't be open in any particular location
- the first thing that you should make sure you do is open up the folder that contains the stuff that you want to work on
- not doing this is a common cause of modules not being found when you run something
- so make sure to open up a particular folder
- once you've done that, you'll see the name of the opened folder as the second thing in the file explorer

_gesture to current folder name_

- another common mistake is to think that you've opened a folder, when really you're just looking at your open editors

_gesture to the dropdown above the current folder within the explorer_

<!-- CREATING FILES AND FOLDERS -->

- I find that the best way to create files is using the little icons that appear to the right of your current folder name when you hover near it

_hover near it_

- i think it's best because it makes you name the file immediately and add the right extension, which makes vscode add useful code formatting appropriate to that file type

_click it_

- you can do the same for folders using the next icon

_gesture to the next icon_

<!-- SEARCHING YOUR CODEBASE -->

- you can search through your entire codebase using the search feature

_click search icon_

<!-- EXTENSIONS -->

- one of the best things about vscode is that you can add all kinds of extra functionality to it using extensions

_gesture at the extensions icon_

- you can search through thousands of available extensions

_search for aws extension_

- these then add extra tools to your vscode

_gesture to any extra extensions you have installed_

<!-- COMMAND PALETTE -->

- vscode has a huge number of configurable settings and controls
- you can access all of them through the command palette
- you can open it using `CTRL+SHIFT+P` on windows or `CMD+SHIFT+P` on mac
- from here you can search for whatever control you might be looking for
