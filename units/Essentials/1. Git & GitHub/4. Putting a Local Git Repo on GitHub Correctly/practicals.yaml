    1. On VSCode, open a `README.md` file in a Git repo
    2. Type "This is a test repo" in the file and save it
    3. Add the recent changes Git's staging area
    4. Commit the staged changes with a message saying "Adds text to README".
    5. Push the changes you made on your local repository to the remote repository
    6. Navigate to GitHub and open the `README.md` file on GitHub. You should see "This is a test repo" in the file on GitHub.
    7. Go back to the `README.md` file on VSCode and make more changes
    8. Add the new changes to Git's staging area, commit the staged changes and push to GitHub.

    1. Add a new print statement to a `test.py` file
    2. Add it to staging
    3. Oh no that was actually a mistake! I didn't mean to stage it
    4. Use `git reset` to reset the staging area
    5. Make a new branch called `enhancement/1`
    6. Make a file called `test.txt` and add a text on the first line
    7. Switch back to your default (main) branch, depending on the name Git used to initialised your repo (don't merge the changes)
    8. Make another branch called `enhancement/1`
    9. Make ANOTHER file called `test.txt` (we're trying to cause a merge conflict)
    10. Add and commit the change to this branch
    11. Now merge `enhancement/1` into `enhancement/2` (which branch does that mean you need to run the command from?). You should get a merge conflict in that file where incompatible changes have been made
    12. Fix the conflict by editing the file
    13. Commit the fix
    14. Merge the changes into your main branch
