<!-- MOTIVATION -->

- github can be used to collaborate on code with others
- when collaborating, you should be working on separate branches
- you should make sure that the other person is happy with you merging branches together
- so instead of merging them from the command line locally, you can submit a request to merge them through github
- we call this making a "pull request"
- called a pull request because you are requesting someone else's permission to

- importantly, pull requests are almost always referred to as "PR"s
- so now when you hear that you'll know what it means

<!-- HOW TO PULL REQUEST -->

<!-- OVERVIEW PR PAGE -->

- you can see the commits requesting to be merged in the conversation tab
- you can also leave

<!-- ONCE YOU'RE HAPPY, YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE CAN MERGE THE CHANGES -->

- once you're happy, you or someone else can merge the changes
- amonst other things, which I will leave you to explore, you can configure who is able to approve and merge PRs in the settings tab of the repo

<!-- WORKFLOWS -->

- you can also configure checks or code to run which can block merging if it needs to
- for example, I've got this WIP bot
- you could for example configure tests to run and check that your code works before allowing PRs to be merged

<!-- CODE REVIEWS -->

- the files changed tab of PRs are also where "code reviews" happen
- collaborators can see changes, leave comments, and approve or request changes, as well as give feedback
- all of them will then show up in the conversations tab

<!-- OUTRO -->

- prs are maybe one of the most important concepts in github and professional code collaboration, so get used to them
