  name: Use the Debugger in the Script
  description: |+
    1. Download the following [file](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Debugging/example.py)
    2. Use the debugger tool to add one break point inside the loop, and another one inside the `dummy_fun` function
    3. Press the "Continue" button until the script finishes
      - At every iteration, observe the Debug Console
        - What is the value of `x` at each iteration?
      - How many times does it run through the loop?
      - How many times does it run through the function?
