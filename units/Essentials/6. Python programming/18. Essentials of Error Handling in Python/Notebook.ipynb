    "## Introduction\n",
    "- It is general knowledge that programs occasionally throw errors.\n",
    "- In Python, once there is an error, the code execution halts immediately, thereby preventing any subsequent code from running.\n",
    "- To circumvent this, error and exception handling is exploited, allowing blocks of code to run despite the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant Keywords\n",
    "Here, we introduce three new keywords: __try__, __except__ and __finally__.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- The __try__ clause: this indicates the block of code we intend to run; it will be completed only in the absence of errors.\n",
    "- The __except__ clause: if there is an error in the try clause, the execution will be halted, and the except clause will be executed.\n",
    "- The __finally__ clause: this is the block of code to be run regardless of any error.\n",
