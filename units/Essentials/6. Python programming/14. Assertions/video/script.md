<!-- MOTIVATION -->

- sometimes you need to assert that some condition is true in your code
- for example, that a person's age is above a certain value

<!-- assert statement with bool value -->

- you can do this in python using the assert keyword
- it's followed by an expression which will either result in true or false
- if the assertion holds true, the code will continue
- otherwise it will throw an error

- if you want to throw a specific error message when the assertion is not met, then you can add a message after the condition, separated from it by a comma
