    1. Create an empty tuple without Python's built-in function
    2. Create an empty tuple with Python's built-in function
    3. Create a tuple that contains three different data types
    4. Merge the two of the tuples you created using the + operator
    5. Iterate over one of the tuples and print out tuples

  description: |+
    1. Count the number of i's in the tuple
        `vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'i', 'u')`
    2. Count the number of 7's in the tuple
        `numbers = (1, 7, 2, 7, 3, 7, 4, 7, 5, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7)`
    3. Count the number of [1, 2, 3] lists and ('f', 'd') tuples in the tuple
        `tuple = (1, 'f', [1, 2, 3], [4, 5], ('f', 'd'), ('f', 'd', 'e'), [1, 2, 3], 'a')`

  name: Indexing Tuples
  description: |+
    You have a tuple `vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'i', 'u')`
    1. Find the first occurence of 'e' element
    2. Find the first occurence of 'i' element
    3. Find the first occurence of 'b' element. What does this return? What is the meaning of this error?
 
    The index() method can take one to three parameters. We used one of them so far: element, the item to scan.
    The two other paramaters this method can take are:
        - start_index - scanning of the element will start from the start_index
        - end_index - scanning of the element will stop at the end_index
    
    4. Find the first occurence of 'i' elemnts from index 4 to 8 in the following tuple
         `alphabet = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'g', 'l', 'i', 'u')`

  name: Unpacking Tuples
  description: |+
    1. Initialise a tuple that contains four different data types. Unpack the tuple and print out each variable.
    2. Given a `tuple = (70, "AiCore", 10, "Programming", 70)` and x, *y, z = tuple. What do you think 
    the output of the following print statements will be?
      - print(x)
      - print(y)
      - print(z)
    3. Given a `tuple = (70, "AiCore", 10, "Programming", 70)` and x, y, *z = tuple. What do you think 
    the output of the following print statements will be?
      - print(x)
      - print(y)
      - print(z)
