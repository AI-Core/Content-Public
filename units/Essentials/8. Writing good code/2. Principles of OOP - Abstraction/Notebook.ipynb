Implementing methods in the same class for including a model might be confusing, considering that the class is responsible solely for downloading the images. For cases such as this, the solution is to increase the granularity."

    "The term, abstract, in programming is very similar to the concept of abstract in art: extracting certain ideas and removing the specifics. When you browse a webpage, you do not worry about the intricacies, you simply view the layout _(the main idea)_, exclusive of the specifics _(the work behind it)_. In other words, data abstraction is similar to a black box.\n",

    "As a solution, we can apply abstraction to group different functions that will exhibit a specific behaviour. The gathered functions will accept certain input types and return certain output types. This indicates that if you find a bug or you intend to tweak a function inside the functions, you can modify it without changing the output type.\n",
