- one thing that I cannot emphasise enough is that you should be able to understand what a variable represents just by reading its name

- the thing that annoys me most is when people think they are being smart by using as few characters as possible for their variable names
- but then they come back a day later and cannot understand what their code does

- never sacrifice readability for variable name length
- A long but clear variable name is always better than a short but vague name

_Switch to screen capture_

- for example
- this short, ambiguous variable name should definitely be replaced by something like this

_Replace `x` with `exponential_rolling_average`_

- I really don't want to see variable names like "x"

- a lot of the time, I see people using acronyms to name variables too

_Replace `exponential_rolling_average` with `era`_

- this just causes the same problem - where you forget the acronym later!

_undo_

- another way to come up with bad variable names is to use a generic name like output, result or value

_Replace `exponential_rolling_average` with `result`_

- by reading these names, you can't understand what the variable is the output of

_Switch to webcam_

- so to summarise, always stress test your variable names by asking yourself if you would know what it meant just by reading the name
- make it super clear
