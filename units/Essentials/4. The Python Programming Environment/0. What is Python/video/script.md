- python is a programming language
- it's quite a high level programming language, which means it's closer to human language than a lower level language like C++, for example
<!-- TODO describe what machine code is and explain that it's the lowest level    -->
- the usefulness of it being a higher level programming language is that it's easier to read and write
- that makes it a good language to get started with
- the downside is that it might not be as fast or allow us as much control
- python is also an interpreted language rather than a compiled language
- that means that it is going to run line by line by our computer, rather than being all of it being compiled into machine code in advance
- python is an open source language, meaning that you can see all of the underlying code free online, and even contribute to it
- it has a huge community of developers who have created an abundance of software in python that you can import and use as a starting point, so that you don't have to write everything yourself
- we call these 3rd party softwares "libraries" or "modules"
- some python libraries for data analysis and machine learning have become extremely popular, and as a result have propelled python into being the language of choice for data and AI applications
