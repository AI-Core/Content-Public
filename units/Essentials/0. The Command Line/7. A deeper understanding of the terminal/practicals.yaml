    Create temporary aliases
    1. Echo "Python is fun!" to the standard output
    2. Create an alias called `pif` for the above command. 
    3. Run `pif` in the terminal and observe the output
    4. Close your terminal and reopen it
    5. Run `pif` again to confirm that the alias has not persisted and now cannot be found. It was only defined in your previous terminal!

    Define aliases that persist between terminal sessions
    1. Open the `.bashrc` file in your home directory with your favorite editor
    2. Add an alias with the name `hw` into the `.bashrc` file which runs an `echo` command to echo "Hello from .bashrc". Save the file and close it.
    3. Run `source ~/.bashrc` in the terminal to run the commands in that file
    4. Type the name of your alias and run it
    5  Close and your terminal and open a new one
    6. Run your alias again. You should see the echo you defined in your `.bashrc`
    7. Go ahead and create other useful aliases for your commonly used terminal commands.
