<!-- LIKE SPREADSHEET -->

- tabular data is the kind of data that you'd can store in a table of rows and columns
- which is why we call it tabular data

<!-- ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN STORE IN A SPREADSHEET -->

- it's the kind of data you'd find in a spreadsheet

- but it could be stored in a number of other formats too
<!-- MIGHT BE IN A spreadsheet, a  CSV FILE, EXCEL SHEET, DATABASE, PYTHON DICTIONARY -->

_show google sheet_

_show csv file_

_show JSON_

- all of these file types contain the same tabular data

- there's no constraint on what the type of the value for each column is, but it should be consistent between examples

<!-- BASICALLY ANY DATA WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT EACH VALUE REPRESENTS -->

- a key characteristic of tabular data is that you know what each column represents
- and it represents the same thing for each example that corresponds to a row
- because of that, we might say refer to it as a structured data

<!-- OUTRO -->

- and you're going to see tabular data everywhere
