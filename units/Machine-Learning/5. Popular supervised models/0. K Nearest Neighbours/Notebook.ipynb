    "- Generated machine code is tailored to your specific CPU architecture (specific low-level instructions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `numba` when `numpy` code is really hard to vectorize (__take some time to come up with vectorized solution always, this is your last resort__)\n",
    "- Use `numba` for functions which either:\n",
    "    - take long to run (so the compilation time does not impact the runtime)\n",
    "    - are run many times\n",
    "- Take care of arguments and their type specification (next notebook)\n",
    "- Use `njit` whenever possible\n",
