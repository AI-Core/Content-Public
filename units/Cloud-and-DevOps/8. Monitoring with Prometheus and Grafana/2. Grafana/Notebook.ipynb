    "\n",
    "Firstly we will need to go to the Grafana download page [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/download) and select the version you would like to install for your operating system and follow the instructions to install it. Grafana will then be configured as a service or server on your system. You can then access the Grafana login page from `localhost:3000`. Initially you will login using `admin` as the username and `admin` as the password, Grafana will then ask you to configure a new admin password before logging in.\n",

    "- **Compass** Run queries from your data sources to see the outputted graph without commiting it to a dashboard yet.\n",
    "- **Bell** Setup alerts for your metrics and how you will be notified if they reach the threshold.\n",
