- torch provides easy access to some of the most common datasets
- depending on whether you're looking for an image, audio, or text dataset, you'll find the datasets inside the torchvision, torchaudio, or torchtext modules respectively

_Point to links to each of these modules respectively_

- inside torchvision, you'll find classis datasets like MNIST and imagenet, as well as many more

- some are for far more sophisticated tasks like instance segmentation or optical flow
- in torchaudio you'll find audio datasets for a variety of transcription tasks, including in lesser spoken languages

- and in torchtext you'll find text datasets for things like sentiment analysis, question answering, and machine translation

- all of these are really easy to use
- they all work in roughly the same way
- and the differences and specific implementations are explained in the docs

- let's go through getting the MNIST dataset working now
