1. Skim through the pytorch notebook. Don't worry about taking everything in, but use it to get an overview of what pytorch is and how it can be used.
2. Take a browse around the pytorch [docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). Particularly interesting places to start might be:
    - torch.nn. Recognise any of the names?
    - torch.linalg. Recognise any familiar methods?
    - torch.optim. Notice any familiar algorithms?
    - torch.utils.tensorboard. How could we use this to visualise our training?
3. Implement linear regression in PyTorch (just the forward pass)
4. Sketch out the computational graph for a linear regression model. Ask someone if they think it looks right.
3. Read through the Metrics and training loop notebook
    - How can we save and load models?
    - What are the key components of a training loop? Which parts are absolutely necessary? Which are nice to haves?
