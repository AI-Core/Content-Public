    "# MLFlow for Model Registry\n",
    "\n",
    "> A __model registry__ is a central place to store (register) models\n",
    "\n",
    "MLFlow provides a popular model registry\n",
    "\n",
    "> The MLFLow model registry  manages the lifecycle of `MLModel` (lineage (which experiment and run produced it), version, staging, annotations)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLFlow model registry can be set up as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t\tmlflow server \\\n",
    "\t\t\t--backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db \\\n",
    "\t\t\t--default-artifact-root ./artifacts \\\n",
    "\t\t\t--host 127.0.0.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> COMMON ISSUE: To connect to a mlflow server, you need to have an environment model called `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` set. \n",
    "\n",
    "One error which this can cause is the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE:  Model registry functionality is unavailable; got unsupported URI './mlruns' for model registry data storage. Supported URI schemes are: ['postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite', 'mssql']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, let your MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember, that this environment variable will only be set in the teminal you run it in. If you quit this terminal, you'll need to run that command again when you open up a new terminal. To avoid this, add that line to your `.bashrc` file, which runs every time you open a new terminal (or corresponding file depending on which terminal you use).\n",
    "\n",
    "> COMMON MISTAKE: The Python API method `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(...)` will only work if your `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable is already set, in which case it will replace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the docs [here](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#mlflow-tracking-servers)\n",
    "\n",
    "A few new concepts are introduced:\n",
    "- __Registered model__ - `MLModel` which was explicitly registered (with metadata mentioned above)\n",
    "- __Model version__ - First registered model gets a `1` which is incremented after each new model registration\n",
    "- __Model stage__ - similar to `git` or data warehouses:\n",
    "    - `staging`\n",
    "    - `production`\n",
    "    - `archived`\n",
    "- __Model annotations__ - markdown documenting the model (algorithm description, dataset used etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above has to be done __after saving model via `log_model`__ and can be done via __API or UI__.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use API, to check how to do it via UI look [here](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#ui-workflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three programmatic ways to register the model:\n",
    "- Via `log_model`'s `registered_model_name` argument; __when we want to register model from each experiment__\n",
    "- [`mlflow.register_model`](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.register_model); __explicit registration of chosen model with run `id` specified__\n",
    "- [`mlflow.Client`'s `create_registered_model`](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html#mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient.create_registered_model); __like above, but Client is connected to specific run hence no need for explicit run `id` specification__"
