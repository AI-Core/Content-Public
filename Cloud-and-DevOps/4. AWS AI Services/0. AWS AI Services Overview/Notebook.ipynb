    " # AWS ML Services Overview\n",
    "\n",
    " Amazon AWS has a multitude of prebuilt AI services which are prepackaged to be integrated into any orgainisations workflow. Each service is custom built for the task and ease of use and in some cases only needs the required data and no prior machine learning knowledge to be implemented. These services range from creating image recognition applications, text to speech, text extraction to a fully comphrehensive machine learning suite Amazon SageMaker. Below you will see many of the machine learning services offered by AWS with a description and use cases for each. Addtional services can be explored through the [AWS management console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).\n"
