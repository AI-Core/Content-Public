CloudWatch monitors your data in the form of logs, events and metrics providing you insight into all your AWS applications and services. You can use CloudWatch to detect undesirable application behaviour, set alarms, visualise logs/metrics, troubleshoot applications and take automated action to keep your services running.\n",
