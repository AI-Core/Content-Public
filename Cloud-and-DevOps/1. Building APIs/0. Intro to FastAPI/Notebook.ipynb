    "> ## According to the official website, FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages about using FastAPI with respect to other web frameworks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __It is intentionally easy to use__: The code structure and its encapsulation make it very intuitive to find the methods you are looking for in no time\n",
    "2. __Fast to code__: FastAPI does lots of the hard work for you, simply add the type of request to be expected, and the corresponding response.\n",
    "3. __It uses both OpenAPI and JSON__: This way, not only will your browser be able to display the data nicely, but also, the user will be able to retrieve the data efficiently.\n",
    "4. __Queries are much easier to format__: Remember that lesson about type hinting? This is where it comes in extremely handy. By default your queries will have `str` format, but if you give a specific type hint in your functions, the input will be casted to that type\n",
    "5. __It processes requests asynchronously__: You can send multiple requests to a FastAPI server while it is computing the operation from a previous request, so you don't have to wait for the previous request to finish to be able to accept new requests\n",
    "6. __It integrates Dataclass__ decorators, which make it even easier to get your application up and running\n",
    "7. __It integrates pytest__ so your API can be easily tested before being deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is relatively new (compared to Flask or Django for example), and adoption is growing faster. You might also want to check other libraries such as Tornado or Hug to create applications. However, due to its power and simplicity, we are going to focus on FastAPI."
