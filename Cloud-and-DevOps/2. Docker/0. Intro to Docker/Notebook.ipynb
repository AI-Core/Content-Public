    "\n",
    "But wait... What is a container? You can think of a container as a Virtual Machine (VM), however, whilst a VM virtualises the hardware (how much RAM, memory you have), a container only virtualises the Operating System (OS). However, Docker doesn't just make a copy of the OS you want to work with, it will provide the necessary tools that will make the specific OS run. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's say for example that your application runs in the latest ubuntu version. Docker will NOT install the latest version each time you need to run your application, it will simply get the tools necessary to run that version without installing a whole OS. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, you might be wondering that even the tools might need a time to be installed right? That's correct, but the good thing about Docker is that it install them only once (unless you unistall it), and next time you want to run the same application, Docker will know where these tools have been installed. To do so, Docker relies on a powerful tool named Docker images, which are the templates to run containers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of Docker images as Python classes, and containers as the Python instances. The image is the blueprint that indicates all the steps needed to run the container in which your application is held. The first time you `build` the image, those tools you need to run your application will be downloaded and installed, and Docker will know how to access those tools when you run you application again. \n",
    "\n",
    "One nifty trick Docker does to be more efficient is that those tools can be shared between images, so if you create another image where those tools are used again, Docker won't download or install them, because it knows how to find them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <font size=+1>Docker allows us to package our code, apps etc. with all the necessary dependencies in a self-contained environment called a `Docker image`. We can then create instances of these images, which we call `Docker containers` </font>"

If we wanted, say for example, deploy the whole virtual machine, we would need to install and launch the whole operating system everytime we want to run the application. Containers takes the best of both worlds and combines the lightweightness of deploying an application the traditional way with the fact that we can take into account that it can run in multiple applications.\n",
