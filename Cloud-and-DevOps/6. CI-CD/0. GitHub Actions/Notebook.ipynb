    "# CI, CD & GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "> GitHub Actions allow us to automate various stages of software development if one uses GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of GitHub actions are:\n",
    "- __event driven__ - if something happens inside our GitHub repository (e.g. pull request) we can run automated piece of code\n",
    "- __configuration-oriented__ - we use `.yaml` to configure necessary __workflows__\n",
    "- __customizable__ - we can create our own specific GitHub Action with `docker` or JavaScript\n",
    "- __allows simple Continuous Integration (CI)__ - each Pull Request/Merge can be automatically tested\n",
    "- __allows simple Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)__ - after our tests passed we can create a pipeline which automatically deploys our code for others to use\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the last points:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "> __A way of integrating software changes from multiple contributors__\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually this consists of:\n",
    "- assessing code quality (via automated code assessment, reviews or both)\n",
    "- assessing adherence to the project's best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Using GitHub Actions we can do all of the above and more in order to streamline code merging process (e.g. automatically label \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Testing that our production code is always ready to be deployed (e.g. bug free)__\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of:\n",
    "- checking changes against integration tests (or a whole suite of them)\n",
    "- testing every feature that's supposed to be merged\n",
    "- fast landing of necessary fixes (users always have the best possible version of the product available)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Deploy automatically (or after approval) your tested code__\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often confused with continuous deployment (and those sometimes functions as a synonym)\n",
    "\n",
    "__This approach may not be suitable for every project you create (and might be hard to get finished), though brings great benefits if done correctly__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amongst the things one \"has to set up\" could be:\n",
    "- automated/easy rollbacks (when our tests fail to catch critical flaws)\n",
    "- test optimization - run only necessary parts of tests in order to speed up/make the process more cost effective\n",
    "- automated deployment of the changes into production (e.g. creating images, containers and deploying them on Kubernetes as a new version of software)"

    "Key concepts in GitHub Actions one should understand are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Events__ - anything that happens inside the repository like new issue, pull request, merging etc. (__external events are allowed via [webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event)__)\n",
    "- __Workflow__ - automated procedure added to the repository. Workflows consist of...\n",
    "- __Jobs__ - set of steps running on the same machine\n",
    "- __Step__ - individual task which can run __action__/shell commands on the machine\n",
    "- __Action__ - standalone commands __set up individually in separate/the same GitHub repository__\n",
    "- __Runner__ - server with [Github Actions runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-latex) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/github-actions-design.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to keep in mind:\n",
    "- [Full list of events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) triggering workflows\n",
    "- __Jobs in a workflow run in parallel by default__\n",
    "- __We can create dependencies between jobs__ (for example deployment relies on testing job passing correctly)\n",
    "- __We can use any action set up publicly__ (for example: [create LaTeX documents](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-latex) with actions)\n",
    "- __Runners are provided by GitHub for free__ (see limits in different tiers [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration))\n",
