    "# Regression Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are familiar with classification metrics, we can go over regression problems, which deal with numerical quantities rather than categorical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple fact means that __the same evaluation metrics used in classification cannot be used for regression models__. In classification metrics, we base all metrics on binary concepts such as 'correct' and 'incorrect', then binarize multiclass problems so that the same framework applies. But this does not work with regression models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, under a classification frame of mind, if we predict an output of 3.29742 and the true label is 3.29741, this would be classified as incorrect. What is even worse is that other predictions that are much further away would have the same categorisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, with regression metrics, __we do not focus on whether something is correct or incorrect, but rather focus on how similar to the true label our prediction is.__"
