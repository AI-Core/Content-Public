    1. Import the `Iris` dataset using the `sklearn.datasets` module.
    2. Create a multiclass classification model that uses logistic regression, and train to classify the species of iris, using 70% of the `IRIS` dataset.
    3. Validate the initial model approach using the validation set (15% of the `IRIS` dataset). Use `sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score` to check the accuracy.
    4. Find an alternative model that outperforms your initial model. You can also use grid or random search to optimise any hyperparameters.
    5. Use `scikit-learn` or a package of your choice to plot a confusion matrix of your best classifier.

    1. Import the `MNIST` dataset using the `sklearn.datasets` module. 
    2. Perform some exploratory analysis on the dataset - how many entries are there? What do the targets look like? How about the features?
    3. Find a way to show the features of a single example as a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.
    4. Divide the data into train and validation sets.
    5. Use a classification algorithm of your choice to achieve a 95% accuracy threshold on the validation set.
