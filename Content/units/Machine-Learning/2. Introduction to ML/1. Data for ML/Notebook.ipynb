Are the inputs required to have already been processed?), as well as the methods of the model, which the user will be required to call.

    "Preparing the data is one of the most important steps in ML system design. As mentioned above, you need to have a clear idea of what data you will provide, create a good data structure, and subsequently use the same structure to both train the model and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can gain insights into the data by performing EDA; you can create hypotheses about the data and identify the features that are relevant to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data are divided into features and labels. A feature is a characteristic of the data that you are attempting to predict, while a label is the value that you are attempting to predict. For example, in the case of predicting the price of a house, the features include the square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and year the house was built. Further, there is a label: the price of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can obtain more data from a house if you possess domain knowledge. For example, if you know that the square footage per number of rooms is related to the price of the house, you can create a new column to compute the square footage per number of rooms and use the new feature to train the model and make predictions. This is called `feature engineering`, where you can extract features from the data that you have. Eventually, this data can improve the performance of the model. Feature engineering is an art that is quite difficult to master; however, as with all arts, the more you practice, the better you become.\n"

    "Once the data are available, the next step involves training the model. Over the next lessons, we will explore this in more detail; however, for now, be aware that training a model implies that the algorithm will learn to predict the labels from the features. There are many different algorithms for training models, and the choice of one depends on the problem, data, number of features, requirements of the problem, etcetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some rules of thumb that you can follow when training a model:\n",
    "1. Train a simple model first to get a good baseline.\n",
    "2. Train more complex models that surpass the baseline. Explore different algorithms, and compare them.\n",
    "3. Once you have obtained the best model, you can improve it by adding more features/samples, increasing the complexity, etcetera.\n",
    "4. Be careful not to overfit the model (we will discuss this concept later). One way to prevent overfitting is to remove features that are not relevant to the model; thus, you can go back in the process and train a model with less features. This process can be repeated until you obtain a good model.\n",
    "5. 'Refine the model by finding good hyperparameters. A hyperparameter is a parameter that cannot be learnt by a model on its own; it must be set manually by the programmer. For example, if you are attempting to predict the price of a house, you can set the learning rate of the model, i.e. the speed at which the model learns. This is a hyperparameter because it is not learned by the model, but set manually.\n",
