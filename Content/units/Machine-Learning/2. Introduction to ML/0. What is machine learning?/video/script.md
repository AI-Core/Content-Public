# Data for ML

- AI is all about solving problems which we don't know how to write down a solution to
  - For some tasks, it's too complicated to write down all of the rules
    - E.g. how do you tell a robot to walk
    - there are simply too many edge cases to write down
  - For some tasks, we simply don't know how to write it down
    - E.g. How do I describe what effect this drug will have on the human body?
- All of these kind of tasks can be framed as making a prediction from some input.

  - E.g. I can predict the best next move for the robot from it's current sensor readings.
  - E.g. I can predict the effect of the drug on the body given its chemical characteristics.

- The most popular way to make these predictions is to show examples of inputs and outputs to a computer, which can find relationships between the inputs and outputs using algorithms that learn to find the mapping between those inputs and outputs
- and we call those machine learning algorithms
- and there are loads of different ways that those components can be combined to build different machine learning systems that can solve all kinds of problems
