description: Cover the central algorithms and practical approaches that allow machines to learn from data
# objectives:
#   - perform statistical significance tests
#   - understand key theoretical concepts of machine learning
#   - explain the algorithms behind the most popular machine learning models
#   - implement linear and logistic regression from scratch
#   - evaluate and compare machine learning models with appropriate evaluation metrics
#   - use sklearn to build and evaluate models
#   - develop an intuition and rules of thumb to select models based on the problem
