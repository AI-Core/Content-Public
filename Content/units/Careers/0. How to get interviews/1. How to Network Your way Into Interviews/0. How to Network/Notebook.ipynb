    "- Hi [Recruiter Name], I saw your profile while searching on LinkedIn for tech recruiters here in [AREA]. I’m thinking of testing the market as I wrap up my latest project [Project name]. My main skills are [Skill 1] [Skill 2] [Skill 3] Does that fit with the type of roles you recruit for? If you think it’d be a good fit to work together, I’d love to talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messaging an employee to get referred for a job:\n",
    "Often, employees can refer you to the hiring manager even if they’re not doing the hiring. Most people aren’t going to refer you to a hiring manager or recommend you for a position if they don’t know you at all, though. So you need to get to know them a bit first. Here’s how…\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hi [Name], I saw you joined [Company] X years ago. How have you enjoyed the work environment in the engineering department since moving over? I’m beginning a job search myself, and [Company] is one of the top companies on my list. But I always like to ask first-hand about the work environment at a company. \n",
    "Then, if the person responds, you can thank them for the information they shared, exchange one or two more messages, and then ask a question like this: \n",
    "- By the way, do you know if the [Position you are interested in] position that’s posted on [Job platform] is within your group? Or do you know who typically hires for that type of role? I was thinking of applying for the position, but I didn’t want my application to get lost in the shuffle online.\n",
    "- After this, they may offer to introduce you or pass along your resume/CV. If not, you can send one final message…\n",
    "- Asking directly for the introduction:\n",
    "Great. Would you be willing to float my resume over to them?  I’m very interested in learning more about the role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional topics that you could ask about to start a conversation if you like this general type of approach:\n",
    "- How do they feel about the direction and future of their company?\n",
    "- If they feel the company has offered good learning and advancement opportunities since they joined?\n",
    "- How does it compare to their previous company?\n",
    "- How they got the job in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messaging a hiring manager directly:\n",
    "- Hi [Name], I came across your LinkedIn while researching job openings at [Company Name]. Does the [Role you applying for] position that’s posted on [LinkedIn,Indeed, etc] report to you? I’ve spent the past 6 months in building [list relevant] projects and can offer you a mix of expertise in [Area 1], [Area 2], and [Area 3]. If you’re the person in charge of hiring for this role, I would love to share more with you and learn a bit more about what you’re looking for.\n",

    "That’s what will make an employer most likely to want to interview you. Don’t just talk about what you think is important in your background; think about what they’ll find most important for their specific role.  When employers are talking to candidates, they’re thinking, “How will this person’s skills fit into my job?”\n",

    "- Hi [Name],I loved your [Article/Piece of content] on [LinkedIn/Platform] last week about AI and which industries you expect to be impacted most. I just completed a project on [Your Project] and am considering following a career path similar to yours.
