    "## What is a CV? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the most important details, here’s the basic definition of CV\n",
    "\n",
    "> The point of a CV is to showcase your qualifications and demonstrate why you are a strong candidate for the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying for a job in tech, a CV can help you stand out from other applicants by highlighting your technical skills and experience. It can also provide details on your past projects, programming languages you're proficient in, and other technical abilities you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a well-written CV can show potential employers that you are organised, detail-oriented, and able to communicate effectively. In the tech industry, these qualities are highly valued as they are essential for successful project completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a CV is an essential part of the job application process in tech, as it can help you showcase your qualifications and secure the job you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people do not know this but CV stands for \"Curriculum Vitae\"\n",
    "\n",
    "CVs are often used as a filter by employers to help them quickly and efficiently screen job applicants. A CV provides a snapshot of an applicant's education, work experience, and skills, which allows employers to quickly assess whether a candidate meets the requirements for a particular job. Employers use specific criteria, such as education level, years of experience, and technical skills, to screen CVs and identify applicants who are a good match for the position. In this way, CVs help employers filter out candidates who do not meet the minimum qualifications or are not a good fit for the role. A well-crafted CV can increase the likelihood of being selected for an interview and moving on to the next stage of the hiring process."

    "Action verbs and power words are essential elements of an effective resume. These words help to convey your skills, accomplishments, and experience in a clear and concise manner. Action verbs are words that describe an action or achievement, such as \"managed,\" \"created,\" or \"improved.\" Power words, on the other hand, are descriptive words that add impact and emphasize your strengths, such as \"dynamic,\" \"innovative,\" or \"results-driven.\" Using action verbs and power words in your resume can make it stand out from the rest and help you to showcase your potential to employers. It's important to choose the right action verbs and power words that match your skills and experience and to use them strategically throughout your resume.\n",

You can then tweak your CV to ensure that you are highlighting these specific skills and experiences. Remember that tailoring your CV doesn't mean you need to create an entirely new document for each application. Just make minor adjustments to your master CV to highlight the most relevant information for each job you apply for. \n",
