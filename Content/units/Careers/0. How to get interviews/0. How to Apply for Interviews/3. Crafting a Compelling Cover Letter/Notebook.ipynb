    "### So, what is a cover letter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A cover letter is a one-page document that accompanies your resume when you apply for a job. Its primary purpose is to introduce yourself to the hiring manager, explain why you are interested in the position, and highlight your qualifications for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a resume provides a summary of your work history, skills, and accomplishments, a cover letter allows you to go into more detail about why you are the best candidate for the job. A cover letter is more like an email where you tell a story about why you’re a great fit. A well-written cover letter can help you stand out from other applicants and make a strong first impression on the hiring manager.\n",

    "\n",
    "Harry: From my experience in hiring over 20 people, I’ve noticed that what helps candidates to get past the screening process is having one thing which directly makes me intrigued.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be that they’ve worked with the exact same stack as I have, it might be that they have the same hobbies as I do\n",
    "\n",
    "The more you can find out about the employer as a company, and the person who’s going to be reading the CV, then the more likely you can find something that they can resonate with.\n",
