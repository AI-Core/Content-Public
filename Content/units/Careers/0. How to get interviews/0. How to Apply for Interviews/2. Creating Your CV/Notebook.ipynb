    "## What is a CV? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the most important details, here’s the basic definition of CV\n",
    "\n",
    "> The point of a CV is to showcase your qualifications and demonstrate why you are a strong candidate for the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying for a job in tech, a CV can help you stand out from other applicants by highlighting your technical skills and experience. It can also provide details on your past projects, programming languages you're proficient in, and other technical abilities you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a well-written CV can show potential employers that you are organised, detail-oriented, and able to communicate effectively. In the tech industry, these qualities are highly valued as they are essential for successful project completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a CV is an essential part of the job application process in tech, as it can help you showcase your qualifications and secure the job you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people do not know this but CV stands for \"Curriculum Vitae\"\n",
    "\n",
    "CVs are often used as a filter by employers to help them quickly and efficiently screen job applicants. A CV provides a snapshot of an applicant's education, work experience, and skills, which allows employers to quickly assess whether a candidate meets the requirements for a particular job. Employers use specific criteria, such as education level, years of experience, and technical skills, to screen CVs and identify applicants who are a good match for the position. In this way, CVs help employers filter out candidates who do not meet the minimum qualifications or are not a good fit for the role. A well-crafted CV can increase the likelihood of being selected for an interview and moving on to the next stage of the hiring process."

It's important to choose the right action verbs and power words that match your skills and experience and to use them strategically throughout your resume.\n",

    "### Technical skills\n",
    "This includes programming languages, software development tools, data analysis tools, cloud platforms, operating systems, and other relevant technical skills. For example, if you are applying for a software development role, you might list proficiency in Python, Java, JavaScript, or other programming languages.\n",

    "## Skills, whether hard or soft, play a crucial role in job applications. However, there is a distinction between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are soft skills?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard skills are specific and verifiable, such as foreign language proficiency, software expertise, academic qualifications, or technical knowledge. On the other hand, soft skills are more challenging to evaluate and demonstrate. They encompass abilities acquired through everyday experiences, such as leadership, communication, interpersonal skills, and time management. Unlike hard skills, there is no tangible evidence, like a certificate, to validate soft skills. Nevertheless, most job descriptions emphasise the importance of soft skills, necessitating their inclusion in resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What not to do\n",
    "Don’t list soft skills directly in your skills section.\n",
    "- When it comes to showcasing soft skills, certain practices should be avoided. One should refrain from directly listing soft skills in the skills section of their resume. While it may seem counterintuitive, individuals tend to have difficulty accurately evaluating their own soft skills. Rarely does anyone read a job advertisement seeking a diligent, detail-oriented team player and think, \"No, that doesn't describe me.\" Since soft skills are highly subjective, hiring managers are sceptical of self-proclaimed titles like \"visionary leaders,\" \"excellent communicators,\" or \"self-starters.\" In essence, explicitly mentioning soft skills is more likely to result in the dismissal of one's resume rather than garnering further consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to list soft skills\n",
    "Show, don’t tell\n",
    "- To effectively incorporate soft skills, it is best to demonstrate rather than simply state them. The most opportune section to showcase soft skills is the accomplishments section. When crafting bullet points for work experiences, individuals should carefully select accomplishments that effectively exemplify their desired soft skills. Begin each bullet point with an action verb that highlights the specific soft skill in question and utilise numbers and metrics to substantiate it. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customise your resume. While hard skills tend to be more specific to industries or roles, many soft skills are universally valuable. In almost any position, certain \"core\" soft skills are essential, including teamwork, initiative, leadership, analytical thinking, and communication. It is advisable to select accomplishments that emphasise these skills on almost every resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of demonstrating soft skills on your resume:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teamwork skills:\n",
    "In the vast majority of roles, teamwork is an essential requirement. Employers seek reliable, collaborative individuals who possess excellent interpersonal skills and maintain a pleasant and professional demeanor. To effectively showcase your teamwork skills, it is crucial to highlight specific achievements that exemplify your contributions within past team environments. For example:\n",
    "- Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including marketing and web development, to successfully deliver projects ahead of schedule.\n",
    "- Played a key role in a sustainability project, working in a team of 5 to reduce waste by 25% and achieve a 5% decrease in company overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initiative Skills\n",
    "When hiring managers seek candidates who demonstrate initiative, they are seeking individuals who can make independent decisions, work autonomously, and proactively propose innovative solutions. To effectively showcase your initiative, incorporate action verbs such as \"Conceived,\" \"Overhauled,\" and \"Pioneered\" to illustrate your proactive approach in previous projects. For example:\n",
    "- Introduced a new backend project management system, leading to a significant 90% reduction in client complaints.\n",
    "- Identified and implemented steps to reduce return rates by 10%, resulting in cost savings of $75,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leadership Skills:\n",
    "If you're pursuing a senior-level or management position, leadership is likely to be a crucial soft skill that employers value. When crafting your resume, provide concrete examples of teams you have led or individuals you have mentored, along with the accomplishments they achieved under your guidance. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Coached and mentored a group of 30 summer interns, establishing a successful mentorship program for new employees.\n",
    "- Conducted workshops on team building and cooperation, resulting in a remarkable 50% improvement in team productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical & Problem-Solving Skills:\n",
    "Regardless of whether the role you're applying for directly involves data, fundamental critical thinking and problem-solving skills are applicable to almost any profession. Recruiters are interested in understanding your approach to unexpected challenges and how you tackle problems before they escalate into significant issues. This is particularly relevant if you work in a public-facing position or closely interact with clients. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Resolved numerous client escalations, resulting in a notable 40% increase in client retention.\n",
    "- Developed an Excel macro and standardised reporting templates, leading to efficient data collection and a significant 35% reduction in turnaround time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organisational Skills:\n",
    "Organisational skills encompass more than just maintaining a tidy desk or proficiently filing documents. Potential employers frequently seek candidates with strong time management abilities, multitasking skills, and the capability to organise projects, people, and events effectively. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Organised and optimised a new office layout, implementing systems that improved office function efficiency by 30%.\n",
    "- Successfully coordinated the mailing of over 40,000 invitations, formal letters, and information packets annually, ensuring timely and accurate delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication Skills:\n",
    "Communication stands as one of the most commonly mentioned soft skills in job descriptions. However, it can be challenging to assess and evaluate one's own communication abilities. To demonstrate your proficiency, highlight instances where you effectively utilised communication skills in a professional setting. Examples such as organising an event, delivering a presentation at a conference, or leading marketing initiatives are all pertinent illustrations. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Organised and conducted monthly meetings with city council executives and community leaders to raise funds for a city recycling initiative.\n",
    "- Proposed and executed a new marketing initiative focused on digital campaigns, generating an additional $500,000 in yearly revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conflict Resolution Skills:\n",
    "Conflict resolution encompasses more than just high-stakes situations. It includes tasks such as customer retention, resolving disputes, and fostering a harmonious and productive team environment. These examples demonstrate your ability to handle conflicts effectively. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Assisted customers by addressing their inquiries, providing procedural information, and consistently exceeding expectations in customer satisfaction.\n",
    "- Supported management in effectively resolving human resource issues, resulting in a notable 70% decrease in employee complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention to Detail:\n",
    "Attention to detail plays a critical role, especially for professionals in administrative and clerical positions, as well as individuals working with data, finance, or sensitive documents. It showcases your meticulousness and precision in handling tasks. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Handled comprehensive payroll and expense reporting for a 200-person office, ensuring meticulous record-keeping and processing 100% of payments on time.\n",
    "- Monitored inventory levels and successfully reduced supply shortages by 30%, ensuring smooth operations and avoiding disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to customize your resume to highlight the soft skills most relevant to the specific job you're applying for. Use these examples as a guide to demonstrate your capabilities and provide concrete evidence of your soft skills in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between soft skills and hard skills?\n",
    "Soft skills and hard skills have distinct characteristics and evaluations. Hard skills are akin to factual knowledge since they are objective and measurable. Demonstrating possession of a bachelor's degree or proficiency in Python programming can be easily substantiated through tangible evidence such as certificates or a portfolio. On the other hand, soft skills are more subjective in nature, resembling opinions rather than concrete facts. Mere assertions of being a remarkable leader are insufficient to convince others of one's abilities. To substantiate soft skills, providing concrete examples becomes necessary to showcase real-life instances and experiences that support your claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What soft skills are employers looking for?\n",
    "To identify the appropriate soft skills to include in your resume, you can rely on two effective approaches:\n",
    "Analyze the job description: Carefully review the job description to understand the desired qualities of an ideal candidate and the specific tasks involved. For each skill mentioned in the job advertisement, incorporate at least one bullet point in your resume that showcases your proficiency in that particular skill.\n",
    "Explore your industry: Take the time to explore your industry and understand the commonly sought-after soft skills. Research the skills that are valued and desired in your field, considering the evolving trends and demands. Incorporate relevant soft skills that align with your industry in your resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are soft skills the same as personality traits?\n",
    "While there is some overlap, soft skills and personality traits are not exactly the same. Personality traits are inherent and relatively difficult to change, whereas soft skills can be learned and developed over time. Instead of focusing on changing your personality, it's more effective to identify which soft skills you would like to improve and actively seek opportunities to practice and enhance them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan for soft skills?\n",
    "No, applicant tracking systems do not specifically scan for soft skills. Even if a job description mentions \"leadership\" or other soft skills as necessary, simply listing them in your skills section won't necessarily be recognised by the ATS as relevant keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What about career changers?\n",
    "For career changers, many of the transferable skills they possess are likely to be soft skills. If you lack specific hard skills required in your target industry, it's essential to emphasise and showcase your relevant soft skills. For example, if you're transitioning from marketing to project management, highlight your experiences in leading teams, managing campaigns, or organising events, as these demonstrate transferable skills that are applicable to the new role."

    "Sending targeted applications is more effective than mass sending the same CV. Quality over quantity can increase the chances of winning an interview.\n",
    "Don't forget that the recruiter or hiring manager is looking for someone to meet their needs – not someone out to meet their own needs. A tailored resume or CV will directly address the recruiter's requirements and prove that you're the best candidate to meet them.\n",

    "Keeping a master CV template can be a helpful way to organize and maintain all of your professional experience and qualifications in one place. The master template should include all relevant information, such as education, work experience, volunteer work, skills, awards, and certifications.In addition to a master CV template, it may be helpful to have multiple versions tailored to different types of positions or industries. This can help you to easily customize your CV for each job application, highlighting the specific qualifications and experience that are most relevant for that particular position.

You can then tweak your CV to ensure that you are highlighting these specific skills and experiences.

Make a list of the most important skills, qualifications, and responsibilities mentioned in the job description and research common industry terms and jargon. You can also look at the profiles of successful professionals in your industry to identify the keywords they use to describe their experience and skills.\n",
