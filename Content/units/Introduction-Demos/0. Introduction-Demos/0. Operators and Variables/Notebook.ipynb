In particular it is useful to be able to use an object multiple times without having to describe it explicitly each time, or to perform the same operation on different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, it is conventional to use an object repeatedly in a project. Rather than defining the object repeatedly in code, we can assign it to a variable and use it instead. This concept is called __Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)__ coding. You will encounter many instances of this throughout this course.\n",

    "### Variable Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are important rules to remember when naming your variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use __snake_case__: all lowercase and no spaces; underscores (\\_) are acceptable\n",
    "2. Names cannot start with a number or contain these symbols: \n",
    "__\\: \\' \\\" \\, \\< \\> \\/ \\? \\| \\\\ \\( \\) \\! @ \\# \\$ \\% \\^ \\& \\* \\~ \\- \\+__\n",
    "3. Avoid using `l` (lowercase l), `O` (uppercase o), or `I` (uppercase i) as single-character names\n",
    "4. Do __NOT__ use Python keywords (see below for a list of these keywords) or names of variable types like `list`\n",
    "\n",
    "__If you accidentally reassign a Python keyword, use Kernel --> Restart to reset everything.__ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we use __snake_case__ for variable names, to distinguish them from other parts of Python's code. Although there is nothing in the Python language to prevent you from using another convention, we use conventions like this to ensure that other programmers can read our code easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also always better to make your variable name clear and human readable. Never sacrifice readability for brevity. So something like `my_long_descriptive_variable_name` is much better than `i`,  `l_dist_var_n` or `var23`!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For further details, see the **PEP8 style guidelines** [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n",
