    "- An image\n",
    "- A collection of images\n",
    "- A word\n",
    "- A document\n",

    "## Vector representations can have different levels of abstraction\n",

    "- Low level (simple): The values in a vector of input data (the raw representation of the data)\n",
    "- Somewhere in-between: The vector embeddings of different datapoints (representations of the word/image/whatever)\n",
    "- High level (complex): The values in different layers of neural networks (representations of what the network is thinking)\n",
