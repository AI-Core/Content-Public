    "# Automatic differentiation in Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It provides a flexible and intuitive interface for creating and training deep learning models, and also supports tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration. At its heart though is a simple concept, the torch tensor - a variable type that resembles a numpy array. but with added features to perform automatic differentiation.\n",

    "In the code block below, create a variable called `x` and assign it a value of 1.0.\n",
