    "Cosine distance is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the vectors are exactly similar and 1 indicates that they are completely dissimilar. In other words, the cosine distance measures the extent to which two vectors are orthogonal or parallel to each other. It is defined as the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of their norms. \n",
