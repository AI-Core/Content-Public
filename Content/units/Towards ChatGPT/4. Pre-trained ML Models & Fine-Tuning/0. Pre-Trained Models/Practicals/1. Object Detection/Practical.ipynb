    "Object detection networks are used to detect and localize objects within an image or video. These networks can be used in a wide range of applications, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, object tracking in videos, human-computer interaction, and advanced driver assistance systems. Object detection has become a crucial part of computer vision and has seen significant improvements in recent years, thanks to deep learning."
