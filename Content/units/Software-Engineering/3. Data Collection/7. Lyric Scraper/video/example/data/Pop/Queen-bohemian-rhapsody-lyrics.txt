[Intro]

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come

Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go

Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)

I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man

Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me

(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?

Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go

Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!
