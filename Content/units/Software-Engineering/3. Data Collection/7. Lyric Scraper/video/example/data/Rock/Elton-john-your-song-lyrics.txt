[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide

I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do

My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 2]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss

Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross

But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
