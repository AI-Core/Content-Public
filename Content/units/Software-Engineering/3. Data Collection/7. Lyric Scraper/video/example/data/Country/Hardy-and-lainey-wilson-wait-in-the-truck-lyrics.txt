[Verse 1: HARDY]
I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, "Climb in," and in she climbed
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2: HARDY]
Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

[Chorus: Lainey Wilson, HARDY & Lainey Wilson]
I don't know if he's angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
"Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck"

[Verse 3: HARDY]
Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that twelve he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come
