[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
I'ma do my thing (I'ma do my—, uh)
Married to this cash (Married to this—, uh)
I'ma buy it a ring (Let's go, let's go)
My dreads, they hang (Let's go, let's go)
Like Shabba Ranks (Like Shabba Ranks)

My gun Chief Keef (Yeah)
The bitch go bang-bang (Ba-ba-ba-baow)

I rap, I sing (Uh)
With the clan like it's Wu-Tang (Uh)

But I hate niggas like Klu Klux (Uh)

Run up on me, I don't give two fucks (At all)
Chopper leave a nigga so fucked up (What else?)

Sewed up (What else?), sewed up (What else?)
Toe up from the floor up (Uh-huh)
Sip lean 'til I throw up (Uh-huh)
After I throw up, I'm gon' pour up (Yeah)
I need another one (Uh)
Heat up on my hip, I up like the sunrise, I got another sun (Let's go, let's go)
Ran out of ammo, switched to my other holster, another gun (Grrah)
Damn, like, "He got another one?" (He does, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
DJ Khaled with them straps, I got another one, uh-huh (On God)
DJ Khaled, a hundred racks, I made another one, uh-huh (On God)
DJ Khaled with the tats, I got another one, uh-huh (On God)
DJ Khaled, we the best, bitch, I'm number one, uh-huh (Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

Bitch, I'm rookie of the year, ain't no runnin' u-u-up (On God)
We ain't runnin' away from shit, we the ones runnin' u-u-up (That's on God)
No Limit gang the only gang, ain't no other one (Nigga, that's on God)

I'm gon' bang what I bang, ain't no changin' up (On God)
Ain't no changin' up (On God, on God)
