    "# Spark Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "> Streaming is an extension to Spark's core which allows to perform __real life data processing__\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Not all functionalities are available on Python currently, in order to work with full powered framework one should use `scala` or `java`__\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/streaming-arch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow looks as below:\n",
    "1. We hook up to data stream source (e.g. `Apache Kafka`)\n",
    "2. Incoming data is divided into batches \n",
    "3. Batches are processed by `spark` engine\n",
    "4. Resulting data batches are returned (e.g. after `MapReduce` transforms)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/streaming-flow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## DStreams (Discretized Streams)\n",
    "\n",
    "> High level abstraction over stream of data which allows us to easily work it\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be created either by:\n",
    "- Reading directly our data source\n",
    "- Modifying  existing `DStreams` (and creating new ones at the same time)\n",
    "\n",
    "> __`DStreams` internally are represented as a sequence of `RDD`s__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receivers\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every `DStream` (except file) is connected to the __`Receiver`__\n",
    "\n",
    "Receiver's job is to:\n",
    "- receive data from a source\n",
    "- store in Spark's memory for processing\n",
    "\n",
    "__Points to remember:__\n",
    "- __SINGLE `Receiver` USED ON THREAD__\n",
    "- If we use a single thread (or not enough resources in terms of cluster) there will be no threads left to actually run data processing!\n",
    "- __We should give more cores than `Receivers` we would like to run__\n",
    "- We can run multiple streams to get data from different sources\n",
    "- __`FileStreams` are exception as  they periodically query the system for new files__ (and this can be done on a single thread)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating `Session` (__you should always start like that!__)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Receivers reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "Receivers can be split into two wide categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __reliable__:\n",
    "    - gets data from the reliable stream\n",
    "    - sends acknowledgmenet to stream when the data has been processed and saved to Spark memory\n",
    "    - source receives the acknowledgment and verifies everything is correct\n",
    "    - __Example: `Apache Kafka`__\n",
    "- __unreliable__\n",
    "    - either `receiver` or `source` cannot process acknowledgments \n",
    "    - we don't care about sending acknowledgment and data loss is not a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "__First category ensures no packages have been lost during transmission__\n",
