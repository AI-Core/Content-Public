    "# Batch Processing and Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data processing is the process of changing data somehow, perhaps by cleaning it or computing more meaningful information from it\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, there are 2 main approaches to data processing: batch and streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Batch processing_ is where data is aggregated, before being processed all at once in bulk\n",
    "- _Streaming (or stream processing)_ is where data is processed as soon as it is ingested into the system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Micro-batch processing_ is where streamed data is batched into small groups to achieve some of the performance advantages of batch processing. It is somewhere between batch processing and streaming\n",
    "- _Real Real-time processing_ (yes, there are supposed to be two \"real\"s there) is where a system has a requirement to process data in not just _near real-time_, but _real real-time_. In streaming, data is processed as soon as possible, but the processing may not be complete quickly enough to use predictions in real time. With real real-time processing, the results of processing are required right now, not just as soon as possible. For example, in a selfie filter there can't be any noticable delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at batch processing and streaming."

    "## Batch data processing \n",
    "\n",
    "Batch processing is widely used in organisations, as many of the legacy systems were built upon this philosophy of data engineering where:\n",
    "- Data is collected over time\n",
    "- The collected data is sent for processing either at regular intervals, when a certain criteria is met, or when manually performed\n",
    "- Datasets could be huge (terabytes or petabytes in size) and processing this data can be time-consuming. Hence, it's meant for information that isn't very time-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When does it make sense to do batch processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- You already have all of the data in storage\n",
    "- Results are not time-sensitive\n",
    "- Data migrations are required from one storage system to another (such as from on-premise hardware to cloud-based storage)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When does batch processing not make sense?\n",
    "- When results are required instantly or in (near) real-time \n",
    "- When data is constantly flowing in, and operations depend on up-to date results being shown as they arrive (for instance, Google maps)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example use-cases of batch processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pricing products for the next quarter\n",
    "If you want to set the price of 1 million new products for the upcoming season, it would make no sense to do that one by one as they are added to the system. Firstly it would be inefficient to spin up and down compute resources for processing each item, secondly you would not be able to price them in the _context_ of all other items which is an important factor, and thirdly streaming simply adds no benefit because the product prices will not be used until the new season drops, at which point they will all be released at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performing some historical analysis\n",
    "You may want to ask questions about a huge amount of data that has been collected over the lifetime of your organisation in storage. \"What is our most popular product?\", \"What is the most common way we acquire users?\", \"What is the average spend of men, based in London, aged between 20-25?\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "__In the above example, the data flow would be as follows__:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. XML data is ingested in batches into the HDFS raw-layer data lake every 30 minutes (this is called the _incremental data_)\n",
    "2. The XML data is accumulated throughout the day, and saved in folders arranged by day and sub-folders by time of arrival \n",
    "3. At the end of the work day, the newly collected incremental data, in addition to the previously stored historical (full) dataset are processed using a Spark Scala application. This application is a batch job that runs once daily.\n",
    "4. The Spark Scala application performs basic data integrity and quality checks (such as checking for duplicates), and transforms all available files into a file format often used in big data environments called Parquet format. The process can take several hours to complete.\n",
    "5. The transformed Parquet files are then loaded into a new HDFS intermediate storage location called the _decomposed layer_. This layer is used as a staging layer to perform more advanced transformations.\n",
    "6. The Parquet files stored in the decomposed layer are then further processed by a more detailed Spark Scala application that implements more complex transformations as per the business requirements (for example, linking check-in event data to a particular passenger). This is another batch job that runs once per day and requires several hours to complete.\n",
    "7. The final cleaned and processed data is stored in a seperate HDFS location called the _modelled layer_, which is the layer that contains the final dataset that can be used by the various stakeholders.\n",
    "8. Data in the modelled layer is then exposed to the approved stakeholders who will query and analyse that data"

    "Hadoop, which was the first big data framework introduced, it enables parallel data processing on multiple machines simultaneously - we call this a _distributed cluster_.  The tool was extremely popular for various big data processing activities during the past 10 years, but now it seems Spark is replacing it.\n",

    "#### Hadoop consists of three main parts\n",
    "- The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which is the data storage layer\n",
    "- MapReduce, which handles data processing\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Features of Hive:\n",
    "-   Hive enables SQL developers to write Hive Query Language (HQL) statements that are similar to standard SQL statements for querying and analysing data\n",
    "-   It is designed to make MapReduce programming easier because you donâ€™t have to write lengthy Java code. Instead, you can write queries more simply in HQL, and Hive can then create the map and reduce the functions automatically under the hood.\n",
    "-   Hive also includes the Hive _metastore_, which enables developers to apply a table structure onto large amounts of unstructured data. Once a table is created, details defining the columns, rows, data types, etc., are all stored in the metastore and becomes part of the Hive architecture. \n",
    "    -   Other tools such as Apache Spark and Apache Pig can then access the data in the metastore\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hive vs SQL\n",
    "- Hive uses a query language very similar to that of traditional SQL databases. However, Hive is based on Apache Hadoop and uses MapReduce operations, resulting in key differences:\n",
    "    -   Hadoop is intended for long full-table scans and, because Hive is based on Hadoop, queries have a higher latency compared to SQL, making Hive less appropriate for applications that need very fast response times. Why are the queries slower?\n",
    "        - Network latency between distributed machines which store the data\n",
    "        - Hive and Hadoop do not cache data in memory like relational databases do\n",
    "- Hive is better suited than relational databases (RDBMS) for big data warehousing tasks. This is because:\n",
    "    -   Hive can scale up or down as needed using the power of distributed computing\n",
    "    -   Hive is better at handling complicated data than RDBMSs (which are designed to handle less complicated data faster)\n",
    "    -   Hive's schema can be more flexible than in relational databases (which require a fixed schema)\n",

It also supports in-memory calculations, thus yielding results faster than Hadoop, thanks to a reduction in the number of read and write processes. Spark is also a more versatile and flexible tool for big data crunching, capable of working with an array of data stores such as Apache Cassandra, OpenStack, and HDFS.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Streaming, or stream data processing, involves processing data as soon as it is ingested into the software system\n",
    "\n",
    "The main characteristics of stream data processing include:\n",
    "- Data is processed individually as the records arrive (not in big batches)\n",
    "- Data is processed as soon as possible, which means that it's useful for applications where live updates are key such as progressively updating metrics, reports, and summary statistics in response to every data record that becomes available\n",
    "- Modern data processing has progressed from batch processing of data towards working with stream processing, although streaming is not appropriate for every use-case\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an analogy: Historically, you would have to download the whole movie before you could watch it (batch processing). Nowadays you can stream the movie by downloading small pieces at a time (streaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "### When does it make sense to do stream processing?\n",
    "- When the data ingestion source provides data in streaming mode (one data point at a time)\n",
    "- No historical data anaysis is required\n",
    "- When the data is time-sensitive. For example, while using an application like Google Maps which requires constant location data\n",
    "\n",
    "### When does stream processing not make sense?\n",
    "- When any type of historical analysis is required\n",
    "- When the data is not time-sensitive\n",
    "- When complex transformations are required before deriving insights from the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example use-cases of stream processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stock Trading\n",
    "Most trading platforms require analysing data in real-time to execute all orders as soon as they are entered and to provide second-by-second recommendations on which stocks to buy, sell or hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiplayer Gaming\n",
    "When playing online multiplayer games, the system must be able to handle all communication and interactions in real-time as they occur.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data processing is a critical component of an enterprise's technology foundation as it involves converting raw data into more meaningful information that businesses can use to help enhance decision making\n",
    "- Batch data processing is the more traditional approach organisations have used for data processing. Batch is leveraged for handling large datasets that contain historical data, while stream data processing focuses on processing small amounts of newly created data in real-time.\n",
    "- Hadoop, Hive, and Spark Core are the most common tools organisations leverage for big data batch processing at scale. This is because they can handle both structured and unstructured data and can address a wide variety of use cases.\n",
    "- For streaming data, Spark Streaming, Storm, Flink, and Samza are the popular data processing frameworks used in industry. Each tool has its strengths, although Spark is quickly becoming the dominant technology."
