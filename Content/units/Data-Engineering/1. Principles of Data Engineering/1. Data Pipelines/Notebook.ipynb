    "# Data Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to handle the increasing volume, variety and velocity of data in the modern age, the data foundation in modern organisations is becoming more sophisticated. One critical element of a data infrastructure is the data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Data Pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A data pipeline is a set of tools and processes that involve moving, processing and storing data in a similar way that a water pipeline moves, processes, and stores water. \n",
    "\n",
    "A data pipeline might be as simple as moving raw data from a single source (point A) to a single target location (point B), or as complex as gathering data from multiple sources, transforming it then storing it in multiple destinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing data pipelines is the core responsibility of data engineering. It requires advanced programming skills to design a program for continuous and automated data exchange and sophisticated technical knowledge to enable engineers to integrate various tools and technologies together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data pipeline is commonly used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving data from the source of creation to a target storage destination\n",
    "- Wrangling/transforming the data, integrating various datasets and moving the output into a single centralised location (often called a data lake)\n",
    "- Integrating data generated from various connected devices and systems \n",
    "- Migrating/copying databases from on-premise hardware into a cloud-based data warehouse\n",
    "- Connecting a data lake to advanced business intelligence reporting dashboards which are used by the business executives\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is Data Actually Moved? \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a real-world data pipeline is in the below image. This is part of the Emirates Airlines check-in system mentioned earlier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= \"images/emirates-data-pipeline.png\" width=900>\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above data pipeline consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data generated at the source (by check-in agents and the Emirates mobile app) is sent to a mainframe computer and also to a data warehouse for permanent storage. This setup was the original legacy system\n",
    "- Data is extracted in XML format every 5 minutes from the data warehouse and sent to TIBCO, which is a data pipeline tool that has tradtionally been used for some time\n",
    "- TIBCO forwards the data to Flume every 30 minutes. Flume was a new component added to integrate TIBCO with big data tools.\n",
    "- Flume moves the data to Kafka, where it's buffered until specific data criteria are met (time and size related criteria). Kafka was added at a later step to increase address some of the issues Flume faced\n",
    "- Once the data criteria is met, Kafka send the XML files to a big data lake (Hadoop HDFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, data pipelines were usually manually triggered and monitored. More recenty however, tools have come out to enable automated scheduling, running and monitoring of pipelines. Some of the benefits of automation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensuring consistency of the data by re-using the same data ingestion and storing code\n",
    "- Enhancing productivity as data engineers don't need to manually ingest the data on a regular basis and can spend more of their time on other tasks\n",
    "- Providing automatic scaling of the network bandwidth to enable the data pipeline to handle different data speeds throughout the day\n",
    "- Making the code re-usable across the various teams and systems which helps to standardise best pratices"

    "## Challanges Building Data Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating data pipelines in organisations doesn't come without its challenges.  For instance, the data infrastructure can be complex and diversified both in terms of the technologies used and geographic location of the various tools.  Moreover, systems are usually built incrementally over time, so there are a variety of legacy systems and tools that must be accounted for as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up secure and reliable data flow pipelines can be a complex task. There are so many things that can go wrong.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main challenges are highlighted below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "-   Creating data ingestion processes can be complex due to the increasing speed (velocity) of data generation and the growing size (volume) of data files\n",
    "-   Development times can be costly in time and resources (data engineers are expensive)\n",
    "-   Building data pipelines from scratch every time a new data source or business requirement comes up can be time consuming\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data security\n",
    "-   Keeping sensitive details private while transferring data from one point to another is a key concern \n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unreliability\n",
    "-   During data movement, the reliability of the data may be compromised and thus cause incorrect decisions based on untrue or corrupted data. This may occur because:\n",
    "    -   Data can be corrupted\n",
    "    -   Data can be lost\n",
    "    -   Networks can be overloaded during peak times causing delays (latency)\n",
    "    -   Data sources may conflict, generating duplicate or incorrect data\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology evolution\n",
    "- Modern data sources, tools, and consuming applications evolve rapidly. Thus we are faced with constant changes while deploying and maintaining data pipelines.\n",
    "- Additionally, integrating newer tools with older legacy ones can be a daunting and a time-consuming challenge\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data changes\n",
    "- The structure of the data produced from origin could change without prior notice, causing issues to consuming applications\n",
    "- For instance, a new column might have been added that the code isn't designed to handle yet. This will lead to a system error or crash.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintenance and rework\n",
    "- Implementing changes to a data pipeline can be time-consuming and complex\n",
    "- Debugging and maintenance can take away time from developing new features"
