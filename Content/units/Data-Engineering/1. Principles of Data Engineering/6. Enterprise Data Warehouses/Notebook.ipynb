    "## What is an Enterprise Data Warehouse?\n",
    "\n",
    "> An EDW is a data management system containing a company's high-value structured data. It is used to provide data-driven insights and advanced analytics reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDWs have been used by global companies for a few decades. These centralised data repositories were introduced to help integrate the data companies stored in seperate storage silos (such as in different databases). The data was usually transformed and cleaned before loading it into the EDW. \n",
    "\n",
    "An EDW normally consists of one or more relational databases in the back-end, along with more advanced tools to enable real-time reporting and analytics. More details on the architecture will be provided in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data warehouses are solely intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data. The data within a data warehouse is usually derived from a wide range of sources such as: \n",
    "- Various databases within the company\n",
    "- Application log files\n",
    "- Transaction applications (such as e-commerce data)\n",
    "\n",
    "A data warehouse centralises and consolidates large amounts of _structured_ data from multiple sources/databases. Its analytical capabilities allow organisations to derive valuable business insights from their data to improve decision-making. Over time, it builds a historical record that can be invaluable to data scientists and business analysts. Because of these capabilities, a data warehouse can be considered an organisation’s “single source of truth.”\n"

    "\n",
    "<img src= \"images/edw3.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back-end (lower-tier): \n",
    "- This is the bottom-most layer which actually stores the data\n",
    "- Usually, a relational database (such as Oracle or Postgres) to store and manage data is the main data source in the back-end\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intermediate (middle-tier):\n",
    "- In this layer, sometimes called the _staging layer_, data is altered into a more suitable arrangement to enable advanced querying by users\n",
    "- This is an intermediate step to prepare the data for connecting to reporting and visualisation tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Front-end (top-tier):\n",
    "- This top-most layer contains the client analysis tools for visualising and presenting data to business users\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data modelling is the process of defining in which tables data will be stored and how they will connect together\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to illustrate the types of data stored within the system, the relationships among these data types, and the ways the data can be grouped along with its formats and attributes in an easy to understand diagram.\n",

    "- Hierarchical data model\n",
    "- Relational data model\n",

    "\n",
    "> The star and snowflake schemas are types of data models that can contain many dimensions and applies only to structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Star Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "In a star schema, the center of the star has one _fact table_ (a central table which records metrics for a specific event and usually has lots of rows) and a number of associated _dimension tables_ (which has more descriptive information about the data stored in the fact table). It is known as star schema as its structure resembles a star. The star schema data model is the simplest type. The fact and dimension tables are connected together usuing _keys_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example to better understand this. Supposed there is a company which sells cars. Every sale is a fact that occurs. We would store the sales information (such as the number of units sold) in the fact table. Dimension tables can then be added to capture more detailed information such as information about the Dealers distributing the cars, or more details regarding the Products sold. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we would visualise the example mentioned above:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Snowflake Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Snowflake Schema is another popular type of data model. It's an extension of a star schema, as it adds _additional dimensions_. The dimension tables are usually normalised which splits data into extra tables (more on normalisation in the next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below diagram, we can see that the original _Dealer_ table has now been split up into 3 tables:\n",

    "\n",
    "Using normalization in SQL, a database will store different but related types of data in separate logical tables. Joins can then be used to group the related data together while querying. The main objective of normalisation is to increase efficiency by reducing data redundancy to make the data more organised.\n",

    "\n",
    "OLAP does not store data into 2-dimensions (rows and columns). Rather, the tools extract historical data from multiple relational databases and re-organises them into a multidimensional cube format. This cube structure allows for storing data, formulas and other related information which are optimised to quickly create different views of the data on-demand. \n",

    "## EDW Architecture Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main approaches to creating an architecture for enterprise data warehouse systems:\n",
    "- Inmon\n",
    "- Kimball\n",
    "    \n",
    "You might have heard these names before. They refer to the last names of the creators of the EDW architecture approaches. Both Kimball and Inmon’s architectures share the same common feature; each has a single integrated repository of atomic data. In Inmon’s architecture, it is called an Enterprise data warehouse. And in Kimball’s architecture, it is known as the Dimensional data warehouse. Both architectures have an enterprise focus that supports information analysis across the organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some differences in the data warehouse architectures of both experts. Below is a brief summary of each approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inmon (top-down)\n",
    "- Bill Inmon, the father of data warehousing, came up with the concept to develop a data warehouse that starts designing the overall _corporate_ data model first, which identifies the main subject areas and entities the enterprise works with such as customers, product, vendor, and so on, and then defines data marts next (using a top-down approach).\n",
    "- The approach is then to create a thorough, logical model for every primary entity. For instance, a logical model is constructed for products with all the attributes associated with that entity. This logical model could include ten diverse entities under product, including all the details, such as business drivers, aspects, relationships, dependencies, and affiliations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kimball (bottom-up)\n",
    "- Created by Ralph Kimball, the Kimball data model follows a bottom-up approach to an enterprise data warehouse (DW) architecture design in which data marts are first formed based on the business requirements.\n",
    "- The primary data marts are then evaluated, and an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) tool is used to fetch different types of data formats from several sources and then loads them into a centralised staging area of the relational database server. Once data is uploaded in the staging area in the data warehouse, the next phase includes loading data into a dimensional data warehouse model that’s denormalized by nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Charactaristics of an EDW\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether the architecture is based on the Inmon or the Kimball design, all EDW share the following common charactaristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function-oriented\n",
    "- A data warehouse is oriented around different functions of the business, such as sales, inventory, marketing, since it provides information about each of these departments rather than the overall processes of a business\n",
    "- For example, if you want to analyse your company’s sales data, you need to build a data warehouse that concentrates on sales. Such a warehouse would provide valuable information like ‘who was your best customer last year?’ or ‘who is likely to be your best customer in the coming year?’\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated\n",
    "- A data warehouse is developed by integrating data from varied sources into a consistent format. \n",
    "- The data must be stored in the warehouse in a consistent and universally acceptable manner in terms of naming, format, and coding. This facilitates effective data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Version control for data \n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to maintain proper version control for data, all data entered into a warehouse should remain unchanged. Thus, the data is usually read-only. \n",
    "- Previous data records are not erased when new data about the same record is added. This helps to analyse how records change over time. To implement this, records are marked with a timestamp.\n"

    "> Redshift is a cloud-based, big data warehouse solution offered by Amazon. The platform provides a storage system that allows storing vast quantities of data in easy-to-access “clusters” that can be queried in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used by some of the largest companies in the world, including Ford Motor Company, Lyft, Intuit, and Pfizer. Redshift is used to store cloud databases and the related production data. The concept of big data hinges on an ability to process, store, and analyse data at scale, and that is essentially what Amazon Redshift provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features of Redshift \n",
    "- Flexibility\n",
    "    - For instance, companies can choose to create a single node as a starting point, but from there they can create massive clusters containing many nodes for every need they have from reporting to serving customer data. \n",
    "- All-managed Service:\n",
    "    -   Another benefit is that it's an all-managed service. There is no need to manage the infrastructure or perform any updates to the software.\n",

    "> Snowflake is a fully managed cloud-based service that provides a single platform which includes data warehousing, big data lakes, and provides support for data engineering, data science and advanced data sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool has been quickly gaining popularity in recent years especially by global companies. This is because it provides many different services under one platform, which removes a large part of the tooling complexity organisations had to previously go through.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features of Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "- No hardware required\n",
    "- Almost no software installation is required\n",
