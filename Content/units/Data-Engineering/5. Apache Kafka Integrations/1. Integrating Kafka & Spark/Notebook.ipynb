    "\n",
    "__1. Data Streaming:__\n",
    "- This is where the raw data is normally produced. \n",
    "-  It could be either real-time data (such as machine/IoT generated data) or batch data (such as manually entered data into a system).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Data Collection:__  \n",
    "- The data would then go through a Kafka system, which will be reponsible to connect to the data producer on one hand, and the data consumer (in this case Apache Spark) on the other hand.\n",
    "-  Kafka also buffers the data until its consumed by Spark.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Data Processing__\n",
    "- In this topology, Spark (in general) or the Spark Streaming module in particular would be the data consumer, as it'll be on the recieving end of Kafka.\n",
    "- Data arriving into Spark can be analyzed and processed on the fly in real-time (batch processing is also supported).\n",
    "- Post-processed data can then be sent to a persistent storage layer where it will be kept for downstream processing.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Data Storage__\n",
    "- The data storage layer is where the post-processed information is stored.\n",
    "- There are several options to chose from, including Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, NoSQL data stores such as HBase or MongoDB or other commodity hard drives among others.  It's also possible to produce the data to a seperate Kafka topic which can be connected to other downstream systems.\n",
    "- The cleaned, formatted and processed data will then be accessed by downstream systems that perform various analytics and data science work.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Data Analysis/Visualization__\n",
    "- In this layer of the process, the prepared data is fed to front-end systems that are used for business intelligence, analytics and data science purposes.\n",
    "- Data is connected to dashboards and visualization tools which can be leveraged to create reports for top-level business executives.\n",
