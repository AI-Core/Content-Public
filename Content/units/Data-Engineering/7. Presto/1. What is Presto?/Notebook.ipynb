    "## What is Presto?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Presto is an open-source, distributed SQL query engine that can connect to multiple data sources simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "When Hadoop become popular, Hive was Hadoop's de-facto standard tool for data warehousing and SQL-like queries. However, some limitations of Hive started to appear over time, and alternative tools began emerging. Among these tools were Presto (sometimes referred to as Trino) and Impala.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presto was released in 2013 by Facebook. In 2015, Teradata joined the Presto community and started offering support and software updates to the tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Presto can be defined as a data virtualisation or interactive querying tool that runs on a distributed cluster of machines which can connect to various different data stores (for both structured and unstructured data) and access data within these different stores using a single, integrated query. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have data stored in HDFS, Amazon S3 and Postgres, we can access all 3 of them in the _same SELECT query_. This is a very powerful feature that distinguishes Presto from other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an image demonstrating where Presto fits in relation to the various data stores:\n",

    "## Features of Presto\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open-source tool that can connect to a wide variety of back-end data stores simultaneously (including HDFS, SQL databases, NoSQL data stores, S3 and Snowflake)\n",
    "- Uses SQL for data querying. It's dubbed as the \"SQL on Anything\" engine.\n",
    "- It can be considered as a \"Hive 2.0\" tool that excels in fast, interactive queries (rather than long-running batch data processing queries)\n",
    "- Designed from the ground-up to mainly perform low-latency interactive analytics on massive datasets (Petabytes in size)\n",
    "- Uses in-memory processing (similar to Apache Spark)\n",
    "- Seperates data storage activities from computational logic, and can scale each of them independently\n",
    "- Provides industry-grade reliability. It's currently deployed by many well known companies such as: Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, Dropbox and Groupon\n",
    "- Presto views data from a columnar perspective, hence file formats that are columnar-based are the ones the tool can handle most efficiently (for instance, RC files, ORC files, Parquet or SequenceFiles)\n",
    "    - Columnar compression helps to save up to 75% of disk storage space over regular file storage methods"

    "## Components of Presto\n",
    "\n",
    "> Presto is a distributed application which consists of 3 main components: Coordinators (the tool's central brain), workers (which implement the actual data querying tasks) and clients (who submit query requests and get the results)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram showing how the 3 components fit together:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"./images/presto-architecture2.png\" width=600>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's take a closer look at each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinator\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plays the role of the \"central brain\" for the tool\n",
    "- All clients must connect to the coordinator in order to send query requests\n",
    "- Coordinates the data transfer between the worker nodes and the client\n",
    "- Communicates with all remote data sources to access _metadata_ and identify what tables and files are stored\n",
    "- Responsible for parsing, analysing, planning and scheduling all client requests\n",
    "- Contains 3 sub-components that assist in all of the above tasks:\n",
    "  - Parser/analyser\n",
    "  - Planner\n",
    "  - Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worker\n",
    "- Implements all the tasks that have been approved and scheduled by the coordinator\n",
    "- Communicates with the remote data sources (such as HDFS) to read and access the data\n",
    "- Performs all instructed tasks and submits feedback/results to the coordinator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client\n",
    "- There are different tools used to communicate with Presto and tell it which queries to run\n",
    "- We call these _clients_, they send the query request to the coordinator and recieve the final result\n",
    "- Some include:\n",
    "  - Presto's command line interface. Read more about it [here](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/installation/cli.html)\n",
    "  - PopSQL, which is a graphical user interface client. Read more about it [here](https://popsql.com/presto-client)\n"

    "## How do Presto Queries run?\n",
    "\n",
    "From a high-level, Presto queries go through 8 steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"./images/presto-query-steps.png\" width=900>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Client submits a query\n",
    "- The query automatically goes to the coordinator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Coordinator analyses the query\n",
    "- This analysis identifies which data sources are required, and what exactly needs to be done with that data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Coordinator goes to those data sources\n",
    "- It checks the metadata, available tables, column names, and whether or not the user has access to those tables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Coordinator creates the _query plan_\n",
    "- This is done by determining the required steps, checking which workers contain data pertaining to those steps, and scheduling the execution of those steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Coordinator communicates the plan with workers\n",
    "- Once the plan is finalised, it is communicated to the appropriate worker nodes for execution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Workers fetch required data\n",
    "- Once the query plan is communicated, the workers are instructed to go fetch the data from the data sources identified earlier to prepare for data related tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Workers implement data transformations\n",
    "- Next, the workers perform required tasks (such as data aggregation), and send the results back to the coordinator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Coordinator sends results to the client\n",
    "- Once the coordinator has recieved all required results from all workers, the final output is returned to the client/user\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few things to note about how query execution is implemented:\n",
    "- All tasks run in parallel\n",
    "    - If one task fails, all other tasks fail (meaning the entire query fails)\n",
    "- Uses memory-to-memory transfer\n",
    "    - No use of hard disk storage at all\n",
    "- Leverages pipelined execution across all nodes in a massive parallel processing (MPP) manner\n",
    "- Uses multi-threading to ensure all CPU cores are utilized effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Strengths of Presto\n",
    "\n",
    "> The core strength of Presto is a feature called _data federation_, meaning that in a single query, Presto can connect to and combine data from multiple sources \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a variety of readily-available plugins which help to smoothly connect to various big data sources such as: HDFS, Kafka, and NoSQL data stores \n",
    "- Can connect to both structured (such as Postgres) and unstructured data sources (like Cassandra)\n",
    "- Presto leverages in-memory data processing\n",
    "    - Which is very fast compared to hard disk data processing used by other tools like Hive\n",
    "    - Uses distributed massive parellel processing techniques to optimise memory processing\n",
    "    - Implements efficient utilisation of CPU cores via multi-threading\n",
    "    - As memory usage never spills over outside of the RAM, Presto can run without a storage layer. This means that there is no vendor lock-in for any Hadoop distribution, no storage engine technology limitations, and no hidden costs for other storage services\n",
    "- Data engineers can create their own customer connectors easily\n",
    "- Authentication and database table access can be configured in the plugins to allow customised access to certain users"
