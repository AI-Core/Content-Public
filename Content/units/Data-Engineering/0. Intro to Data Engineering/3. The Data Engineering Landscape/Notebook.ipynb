    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen the big picture, and understood the main concepts of the modern corporate big data ecosystem, we'll take a deeper dive into some of the most popular tools and components that we've discussed so far. The components are grouped together based on the layer in which they operate in and the role that they perform.\n",

    "## Data Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick reminder, below are the 6 layers of the modern data ecosystem.  We'll look at the most popular tools for each layer in turn:\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of its release, HDFS offered a much cheaper alternative over expensive databases and data warehouses to store data. HDFS is one of the major components of Apache Hadoop, the others being MapReduce and YARN. It also provides the capability to store both structured and unstructured data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on \"the cloud\". \n",

    "Under the hood, cloud-based systems store their data on a very large number of very powerful server machine located in a single location called a _data center_. Such data centers are typically owned and managed by a hosting company (such as Amazon). This approach to data storage is quickly becoming the dominant trend in industry and is replacing the traditional approach of companies having to purchase and maintain expensive servers and storage devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular types of cloud storage are:\n",
    "- Amazon S3\n",

    "\n",

In a typical enterprise, we'll have hundreds or thousands of such devices, and they all send data records simultaneously. In order to properly capture and process this constant flow of data, a streaming platform needs to be properly configured to handle the data sequentially and incrementally. \n",
