    "# Kafka Hands-On\n",
    "\n",
    "> Kafka is a Publish-Subscribe (pub-sub) messaging system used for streaming data in real-time (in addition to it's ability to process batch data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for Kafka to be able to handle massive volumes of data at scale coming in at rapid velocity, several components are required to setup a robust Kafka system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick reminder, below is the overall Kafka topology at a high-level:\n",

    "## Kafka Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the details of what each component is responsible for, let's first define some of the main Kafka terms we'll be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Events\n",
    "> An _event_ in Kafka is used to store a fact that has occurred. When Kafka reads or writes any data, it does so in the form of events. Events can be thought of as data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "An event typically contains the following properties:\n",
    "- Key\n",
    "- Value\n",
    "- Timestamp\n",
    "- Metadata headers (optional). \n",
    "    \n",
    "Below is an example Event:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event Key: \"AiCore\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event Value: \"User made a payment of $300\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event Timestamp: \"March. 22, 2021 at 3:07 p.m.\""

    "### Producers\n",
    "\n",
    "> A _producer_ is the component that creates data for Kafka. It's an API that enables another tool or an application to publishes/writes data to one or more Kafka topics\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, a producer provides data that Kafka will then ingest. The producer API comes built-in with Kafka and can be configured to connect to a wide variety of data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "> A _consumer_ is the component that reads data from Kafka. It's also an API that's responsible for reading data records from one or more Kafka topics\n",
    "\n",
    "One of key strengths in Kafka is that In Kafka, producers and consumers are decoupled from each other and don't depend on one another to complete their tasks. This is one design feature which provides Kafka with high scalability. We can have any number of producers and consumers in a Kafka cluster and the number of producers and consumers don't have to be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "> Events are organised and stored in a Kafka _topic_. A topic is analogous to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are analogous the files stored within that folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Events (data points) stored within a specific Kafka topic can be consumed once, or as often as required. This is because data stored in Kafka is not deleted automatically after it is consumed. Instead, users can define the lifetime of the data by configuring the corresponding property manually. Regardless of how much data is stored, Kafka will remain a stable system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every Kafka topic is composed of multiple _partitions_, or sub-divisions. When a new data point is written, it is added to one of the topic's partitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Events have keys that identify them. Each event that's consumed with the _same key_, such those having the same `Customer ID`, are written to the _same partition_. Kafka's design ensures that data consumed will always be in exactly the same order as they were written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram showing how a Kafka topic and partition look like:\n",

    "## Kafka Components\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap what we've covered so far in Lessons 1 and 2, there are __five main components__ in a Kafka System:\n",
    "\n",
    "__1.\tBroker:__ \n",
    "- A broker is a Kafka node or server which is part of the Kafka system\n",
    "- A Kafka __cluster__ is usually composed of multiple Brokers\n",
    "- Each broker has a unique ID\n",
    "- Brokers store the topic log partitions\n",
    "- Brokers handle all requests from clients (produce, consume, and metadata) and keeps data replicated within the cluster. \n",
    "- There can be one or more brokers in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a video explanation on brokers, please watch the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A broker can be configured by updating it's properties in the `server.properties` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important configuration options for a Broker are:\n",
    "1. `broker.id`\n",
    "    - This is an integer that must be set as a unique value for each broker\n",
    "2. `listeners`\n",
    "    - This is the address that the socket server listens on (hostname and the port)\n",
    "3. `advertised.listeners`\n",
    "    - This is the hostname and port the broker will advertise to the producers and consumers\n",
    "4. `log.dirs`\n",
    "    - This is a comma seperated list of directories under which to store the log files\n",
    "5. `num.partitions`\n",
    "    -  The number of partitions per topic\n",
    "6. `log.retention.hours`\n",
    "    - The minimum age of a log file before deletion\n",
    "7. `zookeeper.connect`\n",
    "    - A comma seperated host:port pairs each corresponding to a Zookeeper server\n"

    "- Zookeeper is part of the Hadoop technology stack, but is external to the Kafka software itself despite being required to run Kafka.\n",
    "- Zookeeper maintains the state of the cluster (brokers, topics, users).\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration for Zookeeper can be found in the __zookeeper.proerties__ file. The important configuration options which can be found there are:\n",

    "1. `dataDir`\n",
    "    -   The directory where the snapshots will be stored\n",
    "2. `clientPort`\n",
    "    -   The port which clients will use to connect\n",
    "3. `maxClientCnxns`\n",
    "    -   Enables/disables the per-IP limit on the number of connections\n",
    "4. `admin.enableServer`\n",
