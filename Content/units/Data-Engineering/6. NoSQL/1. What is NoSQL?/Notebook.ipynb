    "## What is NoSQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "> They are distributed data stores used to store, manage and interact with semi-structured and unstructured data (but can also manage structured data).\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL stores are distributed, meaning that they run on not just one machine but many. Doing this means that the storage limits increase with the number of machines on the system, so they can scale hugely. That means that the whole dataset might be spread across 100 computers. Often, these data stores also have replicas of the data, in case of machines failing and data being lost on one of those replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, organizations have used relational databases to capture their data and query it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, companies started seeing limitations of traditional relational databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Emergence of new data types such as videos and images due to the rapid adoption of the Internet, social media and IoT devices (variety)\n",
    "-   Increasing rate of data generation (velocity)\n",
    "-   Growing size of data files (for instance, video files can be much larger than CSVs) (volume)\n",
    "-   Relational databases have no flexibility. If you want to add a column, you would need to consider how this relates to other data, and populate its values for all other rows. This can make it difficult to maintain the database schema as it changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, a new group of technologies, termed NoSQL, started to emerge to address these limitations. The first time the term NoSQL was introduced was in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi, who gave the name to his first open-source database that was created at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "__History of NoSQL__:\n",
    "- 1998 - Carlo Strozzi used the term NoSQL for his lightweight, open-source database\n",
    "- 2000 - Graph database Neo4j launched\n",
    "- 2004 - Google BigTable launched\n",
    "- 2005 - CouchDB launched\n",
    "- 2007 - The research paper on Amazon Dynamo is released\n",
    "- 2008 - Facebooks open-sources the Cassandra project\n",
    "- 2009 - The term NoSQL was reintroduced and tools are rapidly being adopted\n"

    "-   __Replication of data stores to avoid single point of failure__:\n",
    "    -   Stored data is spread out on many computers, known as nodes. This group of interconnected nodes make up a _cluster_.\n",

    "    -   Are able to scale across (adding more columns) easily as a result of the schemaless architecture. This is a key difference between NoSQL and SQL.\n",
    "    -   Are able to scale up and down (adding or removing data) by adding or removing nodes (computers) to the distributed cluster (group of computers). This means they can easily handle billions of data points.\n"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- NoSQL is shorthand for Not Only SQL. These are a family of data stores that manage data but operate very differently from relational (SQL) databases.\n",
    "- There are 4 main groups of NoSQL data stores: key-value, columnar, document and graph. Each type is better suited for certain use cases.\n",
    "    - Key-value data stores capture data in a simple format using a unique key and grouping the remaining data as the value parameter. This model is quite simple and is best suited for use cases involving web sessions and shopping carts. \n",
    "    - Columnar (also known as wide-column) data stores organise data by columns (as opposed to the row arrangement approach of relational databases). They are very popular in industry and are used as data warehouses in many global companies.\n",
    "    - Document data stores capture and store related data in a single document (such as JSON). This makes it easier to group related information together. They are commonly used for handling real-time data in organizations.\n",
    "    - Graph data stores are a specialised type that are efficient to storing and querying graph data types, such as those from social networks. They are the least commonly used NoSQL data store.\n",
    "- NoSQL technology provides numerous benefits such as schema flexibility, scalability, lower costs and the ability to manage structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "- Nonetheless, NoSQL tools have some drawbacks especially since most of them are novel, immature, lack wide adoption in industry and don't have the support maturity that relational databases currently have."
