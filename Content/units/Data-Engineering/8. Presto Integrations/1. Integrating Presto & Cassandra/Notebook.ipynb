    "## Why Integrate Presto with Cassandra?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As you may recall, Presto is a powerful data querying engine that does not provide its own data storage platform. Accordingly, we need to integrate Presto with other tools in order to be able to query data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular NoSQL tools used by global companies is Apache Cassandra. Cassandra stores data in a columnar format, and is very fast in writing and storing data. Therefore, one of the common tool integrations used by global companies is to connect Presto with Cassandra to leverage the strengths of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Integrate Presto with Cassandra\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to integrate Presto and Cassandra, we first must have both tools installed and sucessfully running on our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Refer to the notebooks covering [Presto Installation](https://portal.theaicore.com/lesson/6d812d61-a6ec-4e07-a5c7-5364e0823dc9) and [Cassandra Installation](https://portal.theaicore.com/lesson/50cf07cb-28e3-4e0c-9777-6ba221cd3374) for the detailed steps required to install each on your local machine._\n",
