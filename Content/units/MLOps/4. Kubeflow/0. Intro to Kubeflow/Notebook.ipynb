    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Kubeflow is an abstraction layer over `k8s` that simplifies the deployment of `ML`-oriented workflows.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kubeflow vs `k8s`\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to `k8s`, kubeflow\n",
    "- is more Python centric.\n",
    "- uses other cluster-specific projects, such as [`istio`](https://github.com/istio/istio).\n",
    "- leverages `Service`s out of the box and is centred on micro-services defined with `Pipelines`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Kubeflow\n",
    "Kubeflow has several uses, including the following:\n",
    "- Experimentation and hyper-parameter tuning via [`katib`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/) (this occurs rather rapidly, attributed to the parallelisation across clusters).\n",
    "- Deployment and management of complex ML tasks at scale ([`kfserving`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/kfserving/)).\n",
    "- Application monitoring (enabling the easy addition of respective components).\n",
    "- Although it does not officially support `CI/CD`, it can be quite easily combined with popular solutions, including `GH-Actions` and `Jenkins`."

    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "> `Kubeflow` provides various components for various common tasks during a typical `ML` lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Central Dashboard](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/): employed to visualise `pipeline`s, resource usage and other relevant statistics with an intuitive `UI`.\n",
    "- [Notebook Servers](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/notebooks/): `jupyter notebook`s, provided as a means for experimentation, data visualisation and exploration.\n",
    "- [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/): high-level DAGs that enable the specification of the necessary steps for deployment/training/tuning/CI, etc.\n",
    "- [KFServing](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/kfserving/): similar to `tensorflow`'s `Serving`. \n",
    "- [Katib](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/katib/): for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- [Training Operators](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/): operators used to `train` specific frameworks (__mostly `DL` oriented__) to downstream common tasks.\n",
    "- [Multi-Tenancy](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/): IAM specification and isolation, security, and resource sharing across teams."

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into `Kubeflow`, it is important to know what other dependencies (except `kubernetes`) are required.\n",

    "Here, we provide brief explanations of each component. For more information, refer to the respective documentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### istio\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is __the only required `3rd` party addition.__\n",
    "\n",
    "It is automatically included with `kubeflow` during installation and is required for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications are built using distributed microservices.\n",
    "- Each microservice is an instance of a `Service` with a custom `API` and a communication channel.\n",
    "- The difficulty associated with securing and validating services in the __`service mesh`, which is a network of services working together.__\n",
    "- __The increasing difficulty associated with managing such stacks.__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of istio\n",
    "After installation, `istio` allows us to do the following:\n",
    "- Add observability for services (e.g. gathering metrics).\n",
    "- Enable `load-balancing`, failure recovery and metrics __via a simple `.yaml` configuration.__\n",
    "- Secure and validate the services in a `service mesh` (e.g. `TLS` encryption).\n",
    "- Control traffic between services via `proxies`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schemes below illustrate the flow of Services before and after the application of the `istio` mesh:\n",

    "#### Uses of `istio` in `kubeflow`\n",

    "- Employed to apply appropriate policies.\n",
    "- Utilised to add the identity of a `user` for other services that we communicate with.\n",

    "### New elements in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief explanation of the other elements in the image is provided here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Python SDK:__ a user-defined `pipeline` using `dsl`, which is __transpiled to `k8s` readable `.yaml` files.__\n",
    "- __Pipeline webserver:__ gathers data from `Service`s via [`istio`](https://istio.io/)'s service mesh.\n",
    "- __Pipeline `Service`:__ used to observe the transpiled `config` and `apply` it.\n",
    "- __Pipeline `Persistent Agent`:__ (watches `k8s` resources created by the `Pipeline Service`)\n",
    "    - __records `containers` that were executed, as well as their `inputs` and `outputs`__ (either `container` parameters or the `URI`s of data artifacts).\n",
    "- __Orchestration controllers__: control the state and deploy `workload resources` accordingly to defined DAG:\n",
    "    - `Argo` is the core controller (see [here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/) for more information) that __allows the scheduling of complicated pipelines with dependencies.__\n",
    "- __Artifact Storage:__ for storing relevant data, including\n",
    "    - `metadata` (stored in a `mysql` database used as the `PersistentVolume`).\n",
    "    - `artifacts`([`minio`](https://min.io/) or cloud storage (__used for fast `w/r` access__) used as the `PersistentVolume`)."

    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",

    "### Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore visualisation within the `Kubeflow UI` [here](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/output-viewer/). __Consider using a different approach for `visualization`s as `kubeflow`'s target is slightly different.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check out [`min.io`](https://min.io/) to improve your understanding of the cloud-native and `k8s` first data format.\n",
    "- Read about basics of [`argoproj`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/), which is used by `kubeflow` to orchestrate workflows.\n",
    "- Find out if the `Feast` feature store can be used with `kubeflow`. Consult the [relevant documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/feature-store/overview/), __and use it after `feast` has been presented by the `AiCore` team.__\n",
    "- Read about integrated [tools for serving](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/serving/), including `NVidia`'s `Triton` and `bento` projects.\n",
    "- Read about [`kubeflow fairing`](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/external-add-ons/fairing/fairing-overview/) for improved hybrid cloud experience with `ML` and for executing/debugging runs locally. Additionally, with this, it is easy to open an `endpoint` with the deployed `model`."
