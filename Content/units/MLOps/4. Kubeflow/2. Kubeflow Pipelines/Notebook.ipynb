    "- __Local files__ should be used with components, __unless not possible__ (Cloud ML Engine and BigQuery require Cloud Storage staging paths).\n",
    "- Use the aforementioned __pure components__ (i.e. those without side-effects, and no modification should be done without 'informing `kubeflow`').\n",
    "- __Mix and match programming languages__: use other languages if `python` is not beneficial.\n",
    "    - Create a `Docker` image containing the `golang` app which requires some `input`s and outputs.\n",
    "    - Define `.yaml` directly.\n",
    "    - __Use inter-language formats for data exchange__ (e.g. `JSON`, `CSV`, `ProtoBuf`, etcetera).\n",
    "    - It is possible to perform minor pre-processing for different languages with `shell` scripts (__Minor__).\n",
    "- __One output == one file.__\n",
    "- __Do not pollute with temporary data__: temporary data are also__preserved by `PersistentVolume`.__\n",
    "- __Stay local whenever possible__: this approach is always easy and less stressful, e.g. when unit testing a specific component.\n",
    "- __Test in isolation__: use a single container; if not possible, run `minikube` or the like (easy to debug) before going with `kubeadm` and full-blown clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AiCore Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Do not use function-based components for highly complicated workflows__ as it allows you to use packages and `python` best practices more freely.\n",
    "- __Be careful of size__: keep the services within 'reasonable size'.\n",
    "    - use `microservice` to transform data instead of the following:\n",
