    "## Introduction\n",
    ">[Feast](https://docs.feast.dev/) (FEAture STore) is a feature store provider that serves online (for real-time prediction) or offline (for model training) features.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an operational data system for managing and serving ML features to models in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center><img src=images/Feast_Diagram.png width=600></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a feature store, Feast provides single-point access to features, thereby preventing data leakage due to inconsistencies in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the features can be accessed by any team. Thus, Feast reduces friction between teams by providing single-point access and a centralised hub for registering features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the features can be reused not only across teams, but also across projects. Therefore, once a project is finished, the features used in it can also be utilised in the next project without requiring re-engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, knowledge of the features that result in a specific model is important. With Feast, users can track features and their corresponding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "__However,__ as opposed to other feature-store providers, Feast does not offer a feature-engineering service and does not generate statistic reports.\n"

    "Note that if you intend to use Feast with AWS services or GCP to create online features, you also need to install the AWS or GCP dependencies.\n",
