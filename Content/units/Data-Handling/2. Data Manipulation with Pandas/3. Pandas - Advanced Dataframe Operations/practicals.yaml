    Using the [salaries csv dataset](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Foundations/Data_Formats/Salaries.csv)
    1. How many unique jobs are there? Look at the unique method in pandas
    2. Count how many people have the first name "John"
    3. Find the surname of everyone whose first name is more than 6 characters long
    4. Create a new column called "last_updated" where every value is equal to the current time (use the datetime module and format the date in ISO format).
    5. Create a new derived column called "time_ratio" in the DataFrame which is the proportion of overtime pay to base pay 
    6. In one line, create a new DataFrame called "new_df" which contains only people who earn more than 100K base salary
    7. Now create a new derived column in "new_df" that is the sum of their pays, not including base salary
    8. Append a new row to the DataFrame to represent a made up character (Look up the append method in pandas)
        - He/she has no benefits, so set this attribute to not a number using `np.nan`
        - Make up the other column values, but make sure they are standardised to the same convention as the other values in that column
