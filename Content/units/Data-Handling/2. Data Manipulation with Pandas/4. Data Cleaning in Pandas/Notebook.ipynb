    "A critical step before we run our data through the model is **Exploratory Data Analysis**, or EDA. EDA, as the name suggests, is an indepth analysis of our data. The EDA process intertwines data cleaning, dealing with missing values, and visualising data and its statistical properties. Typically these processes are all done together, but for the sake of clarifying the different concepts we will introduce them here separately. I will be providing toy examples through screenshots, while you guys will be trying to apply the concepts to a messy dataset!"

    "No duplicate values!! This is good right? Well... not necessarily. Remind yourself of the second Jane Smith example above. The duplicated method would not have returned true because the whole row wasn't an exact duplicate. To tackle this issue, the `.duplicated()` method takes in two arguments: `subset` and `keep`. For the subset argument, provide a list of column names we want to check duplicates over, and the keep argument takes on 1 of 3 values: `first`, `last`, or `False`. From the documentation:\n",
    "- `first` : Mark duplicates as True except for the first occurrence.\n",
    "- `last` : Mark duplicates as True except for the last occurrence.\n",
    "- `False` : Mark all duplicates as True.\n",

    "Averaging over duplicate values can only really be performed on datatypes which make sense. In the above table, the first two entries have valid times that we can average over. In general, the way we average is by grouping on relevant columns (via `.groupby()`), and chaining this with the `.agg()` function. In this case, we want to group on our subset of columns apart from the columns of interest (i.e. to times). Our argument to `.agg()` is a dictionary with key value pairs of column names and the aggregation function we want to apply over them (e.g. sum, difference, mean etc).\n"

    "### Dealing with Datetimes\n",
    "\n",
    "One common issue you're going to come across is dealing with dates and datetimes (simply a date and a time). Why? Because there are many ways that we can format a date, such as `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YY`, `Xth MONTH YEAR` etc. In our dataframe above, our dates are actually formatted as just one number. Pandas provides us with a useful helper for constructing datetimes - that is, with the [`.to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look into this, it's valuable to quickly introduce how dates are typically stored in computers. Typically, dates are calculated against the number of seconds elapsed since **1st January 1970**. When we want to, let's say, find the difference in time between 3/2/2013 16:00 and 21/1/2013 09:00, the program performs its operations on the **Epoch/Unix/POSIX time** for those values, and we can subsequently code something up to provide us the value back back in a format we want (e.g. 13 days, 7 hours). Speaking with numbers:\n",
    "- **3/2/2013 16:00** = 1,359,907,200\n",
    "- **21/1/2013 09:00** = 1,358,758,800\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference in dates = 1,359,907,200 - 1,358,758,800 = 1,148,400 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "`format(1148400) = 13 days, 7 hours`\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Ok, so to solidify how you common looking datetimes are formatted:\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td><b>Date</b></td>\n",
    "        <td><b>Datetime format</b></td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",

    "Here we see two rows which don't have the correct total loan amounts. Analysing each one individually, we see that the first row's data has most likely had the `pg_loan` value entered incorrectly (£97,000 for a postgraduate loan). In the second, for some reason the `total_loan` value has not been calculated. A naive strategy could be to overwrite the whole total loan amounts with the summation of `ug_loan` and `pg_loan`. This fixes the types of error on which the second row is returned. However there could be an underlying issue because of the first row. If we sum the `ug_loan` and `pg_loan` here, we will create an **outlier** (these will be covered in detail later). In a real dataset, it is a very real threat mistakes like these could occur which compromise the integrity of the data - issues like these can easily slip the mind so make sure you take the time to think through how your actions are going to affect your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned, some aspects of data science are an art - but whatever heuristic decision we make, we have to find a strong justifcation for it. In this particular case, I am going to drop the rows with the incorrect `total_loan` as this error probably occured due to a mistake in human data entry. The rows with `total_loan = 0` probably occured due to some systematic error - perhaps from from some other database where the total_loan amount wasn't present. Other checks considering, one solution we could opt for is to sum the two columns together."

    "More complicated string manipulations can be performed via the use of **Regular Expressions**, otherwise known as [regex](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html). We won't look at regex here but it's important to know about it's power. Essentially, regex allows us to specify rules for strings that we want to match against. It has a very wide application usecase. Some examples include:\n",
    "- indentify emails in spans of text \n",
    "- validate whether a url has a correct format\n",
    "- extract only the digits from a text string\n",
