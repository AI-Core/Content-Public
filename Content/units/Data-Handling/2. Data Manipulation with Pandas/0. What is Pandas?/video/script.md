# Motivation

- Pandas is a python library mainly used for manipulating tabular data - that is, data in rows and columns

_show pypi homepage_

- because python is becoming the language of data
- pandas is one of the most popular libraries in python

_click through to github repo and hover over how many stars it has_

- why?

# Functionality

- native python data types don't make it easy to do lots of the most common operations that you need to do on data

_go back to pypi page and click through to documentation_

_show a section of the docs for each of these reasons_

- things like indexing out certain rows
- handle missing data
- it allows you to perform sql-like operations on data in python
- querying the data to answer questions about it

_show webcam_

- pandas brings all of these things to python

- and the library contains loads of methods that make it easy to do these kind of things
- as well as more specialised functionality for doing things like working with time-series data or dates

- aside from containing more functionality than the native python datatypes, pandas has been extensively optimised, so it's fast

- it's also a dependency of many key libraries in the python data processing ecosystem

# Install

- install it by running `pip install pandas`
- then you can `import pandas` in python files
- importantly, it's a convention that whenever anyone imports pandas, they import is as `pd`
- `import pandas as pd`

# Outro

- if you're going to be working with data in python, then you need to know how to use pandas
- so let's get into it
