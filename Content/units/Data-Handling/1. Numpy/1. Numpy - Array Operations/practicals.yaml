    1. Create a NumPy array of random numbers with dimensions 6 x 10. Call it `my_array`
    2. Slice out the 1st, 3rd and 5th column of the array into as new array. Call it `new_array`
    3. Print the shape of each array you have created.
    4. Try to multiply `my_array` x `new_array`. Does it work? If not, do you know why?
    5. Transpose `new_array` and try again. Does it work now?
