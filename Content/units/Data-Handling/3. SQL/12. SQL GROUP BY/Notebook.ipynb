    "Sometimes instead of aggregating a whole data column, it can be useful to aggregate a **subset** of that data. `GROUP BY` allows you to group records with the same value into one group/set of data, which makes it an indispensable tool to analyse data. Imagine you wanted to check which of your customers were the best and had rented the most movies from you. We could `SUM` the number of rows which exist for that customer but it would take a long time. \n",
