    "- You can often get the same information using a `JOIN` instead of a **correlated subquery**\n",

    "- Using a **multiple row subquery** gives you access to the powerful `ANY`, `ALL`, `NOT IN` and `IN` operators\n",
    "- Using a subquery to create a **derived table** can be a quick way to begin performing a query on a subset of data\n",
    "- Continually nesting subqueries can be a great way to target incredibly specific data\n",
