    "\n",
    "The simplest explanation of a *SQL subquery* is a query which is nested inside another query. You might see it described as an *inner query*, *nested query*, *inner select* or *child query*. Conversely the query than contains the **inner query** might be described as the *outer query*, *outer select* or *parent query*. Subqueries can be useful in situations where a query cannot be easily expressed in a single SQL query, or for breaking a complex query into more manageable parts allowing it to be solved more efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "A subquery can be nested directly in the following SQL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">SELECT</b>: Used in the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from one or more tables\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">INSERT</b>: Used in the `INSERT` statement, it can be used to `INSERT` data into a table based on the results of a query\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">UPDATE</b>: Used in the `UPDATE` statement in a similar fashion to the `INSERT` statement. Can `UPDATE` the results in a table based on the subquery.\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">DELETE</b>: Used as a subquery to `DELETE` all records based on the result of the subquery\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice, subqueries are used in statements which perform **CRUD operations** on the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "They can also be present in the following SQL clauses of a **parent query**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">WHERE</b>: The subquery can be nested in the `WHERE` statement of an outer `SELECT` statement to perform complex filtering\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">HAVING</b>: Can be used in the `HAVING` statement to perform filtering of the data\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">FROM</b>: You will also see it in the `FROM` statement where the subquery will de treated as a *derived table* (more on that later)\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2 style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\"> Writing subqueries</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since subqueries are just nested queries, they can be written just like any queries with a few exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subquery cannot be executed on its own since it should be part of an **outer query**\n",
    "- A subquery should be wrapped in **parentheses** which makes it a subquery\n",
    "- You can nest subqueries within subqueries up to a depth of 255 nesting levels; that's one complex query!\n",
    "- If you reference columns in the subquery they can't be referenced in the **outer query**s `SELECT` unless it's the same table\n",
    "- `ORDER BY` can be used in a subquery but will be ignored by the **outside query**\n",
    "- Subqueries can only have one column in the `SELECT` unless, there are multiple columns in the `SELECT` statement of the **outer query**\n",
    "- Subqueries which return more than one row can only be used with *multi value operators* `IN`, `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, `ANY` or `ALL` (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is for a subquery is much like any other query:"
