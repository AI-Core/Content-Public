    "  As opposed to Windows and Mac, in Linux we need to install PostgreSQL and pgadmin4 separately. To do so, we use the command line\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Let's start by downloading pgadmin4:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:\n",
    "  `curl https://www.pgadmin.org/static/packages_pgadmin_org.pub | sudo apt-key add -`\n",
    "  2. Now, let's add the pgadmin repository to the list of repositories in your system `sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/apt/focal pgadmin4 main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgadmin4.list' `\n",
    "  3. Finally, install pgadmin4 `sudo apt update`\n",
    "  4. `sudo apt install pgadmin4 `\n",
    "\n",
    "  And that's it! Let's install PostgreSQL now:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Once again, open the terminal and run to get the certificates for downloading PostgreSQL: `sudo apt install wget curl ca-certificates `\n",
    "  2. Then, add the PostgreSQL to your repositories: `sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ focal-pgdg main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'`\n",
    "  3. And now, let's install it: `sudo apt update`\n",
    "  4. `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib `\n",
    "\n",
    "  Easy right?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Finally, we need to set up PostgreSQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Verify that postgresql is actually working: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`. You should see something like this: \n",
    "  <p align=center><img width=600 src=images/postgre_linux_1.png></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Now, we need to establish a connection with the Postgres database. First, let's switch to the system's postgres user account: `sudo su - postgres`\n",
    "  3. And the type: `psql` to get inside the application\n",
    "  <p align=center><img width=500 src=images/postgre_linux_2.png></p>\n",
    "  4. By default, PostgreSQL creates a user named \"postgres\", but it's not protected. First, let's go back to the main terminal by running `\\q` and then `exit`\n",
    "    <p align=center><img width=400 src=images/postgre_linux_3.png></p>\n",
    "  5. And then create the password: `sudo passwd postgres` and introduce your password\n",
    "  6. Then, let's create a password for the postgres user: `su - postgres` and then, inside the postgres user run: `psql -c \"ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<your password>';\"`\n",
    "  7. Exit postgres by running `exit` and restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart postgresql`\n",
    "  <p align=center><img width=600 src=images/postgre_linux_4.png></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  Let's finish configuring by running pgadmin4:\n",
    "  1. To do so, first run `sudo /usr/pgadmin4/bin/setup-web.sh` This will ask you to create a user using your email address and a password.\n",
    "  2. Then, press 'y' to confirm that you want ot configure Apache web\n",
    "  <p align=center><img width=600 src=images/postgre_linux_5.png></p>\n",
    "  3. Now, you can open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1/pgadmin4 and introduce your data. If for any reason it doesn't load, restart apache running: \n",
    "  `sudo systemctl restart apache2`\n",
    "  <p align=center><img width=600 src=images/postgre_linux_6.png></p>\n",
    "  4. We are about to finish. Let's create a database. Click on `Add New Server` and then add a name for your server:\n",
    "  <p align=center><img width=600 src=images/postgre_linux_7.png></p>\n",
    "  5. And then, in `host` introduce `localhost`, in username `postgres`, and finally the password you set earlier\n",
