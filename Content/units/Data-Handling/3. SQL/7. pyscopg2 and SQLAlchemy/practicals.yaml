    1. Go to the [Samuel L. Jackson's](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000168/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) and [Tim Roth's](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) IMDB pages
    2. Download the name of the films they played a role in: title, years.
      - If you don't know how to do this using webscraping, you can download the csv files for Mr. Jackson [here](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Foundations/SQL/samuel_movies.csv) and Mr. Roth [here](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Foundations/SQL/tim_movies.csv)
    3. Create two dataframes with the data you downloaded
    4. For each dataframe, and using SQLAlchemy, create a new table in your database with the following columns:
      - `title`: String
      - `year`: Integer
      - Name the tables `samuel_movies` and `tim_movies` accordingly
    5. Create a new table named Common containing the films where Samuel L. Jackson AND Tim Roth both had a role
    6. Create a new table named Only_Samuel containing the films where Samuel L. Jackson had a role but Tim Roth didn't
    7. Create a new table named Only_Tim containing the films where Tim Roth had a role but Samuel L. Jackson didn't
    8. At the end of the challenge these tables should be reflected in your database.
