    ">Views are database objects that take the form of virtual tables, acting like shortcuts to regularly used queries. Queries can be saved as views, so that rather than repeatedly typing out the same query structure, you can refer to the view instead. Once created, views can be used in any subsequent query. They provide a way to encapsulate frequently-used logic into reusable elements, making your queries more DRY. "

    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Representation**: Views act as virtual tables, representing queries that reflect the current state of the underlying tables, but do not store data themselves\n",

    "- **DRY Principle**: By using views, you encapsulate queries you use frequently, adhering to the DRY principle, thereby reducing redundancy in database operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **View Management**: Operations like renaming and deleting views are supported, allowing effective management of views within the database environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Querying**: Views allow users to execute complex queries easily by abstracting the underlying complexity into a simpler interface, improving readability and manageability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Security**: Views can restrict access to data by exposing only specific fields or records, thus enhancing database security through controlled visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL Syntax for Views**: The `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` command is used to define views\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Join and CRUD Operations**: Views can be joined with other views or tables and can be used for CRUD operations, offering flexible interaction with the database\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Materialized Views**: Unlike standard views, materialized views store query results and can improve performance for complex, frequently executed queries by caching the data"
