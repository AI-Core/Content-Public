    With the Pagila database:
    1. Using JOINs, find the number of times each film was rented. Order by descending.
    2. Using CTEs:
      - Define two tables (in the WITH): One which selects all films and film titles, the other which counts the amount of times each film was rented
      - Join these two tables together to return the equivalent result of 1.
