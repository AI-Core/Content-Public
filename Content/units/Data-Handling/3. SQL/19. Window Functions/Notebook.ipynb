    "> Whereas aggregate functions operate on entire datasets, flattening tables and collapsing multiple rows into a single result, *window functions* operate within a defined 'window' of rows, adding a new column entry to each row. This functionality is facilitated through three fundamental mechanisms: *partitioning*, *ordering*, and *framing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Partitioning** \n",
    "    - Divides the dataset into distinct groups or partitions based on specific criteria\n",
    "    - Within each partition, window functions will operate independently, performing calculations on the rows within that group\n",
    "    - For example, in a sales dataset, partitioning by product category would enable separate calculations of metrics such as sales performance for each category\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordering**\n",
    "    - Establishes a sequence for the rows within the partition, providing context and direction to the calculations performed by window functions\n",
    "    - By defining a specific order, analysts can uncover data patterns and trends\n",
    "    - Continuing with the sales examples, ordering by date would enable the calculation of cumulative sales over time, revealing insights into sales trends and seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Framing**\n",
    "    - Determines which rows are included in the calculation at any given point. It defines the boundaries of the window of rows within which window functions operate.\n",
    "    - The mechanism allows for dynamic analysis, where the window can shift or remain fixed based on specified criteria\n",
    "    - For instance, framing can be used to compute moving averages over a rolling window of the past N days, providing insights into short-term trends\n",

    "In this section we will look at some of the most common window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are traditional aggregate functions in SQL, but when used as window functions, they operate on a set of rows defined by the window rather than the entire dataset. They enable the calculation of running totals, averages, maximums, minimums over a specific subset of data within partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `LEAD()` and `LAG()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LEAD()` and `LAG()` functions allow access to data from subsequent or preceding rows within a partition, respectively. They are commonly used to compare current row values with those of adjacent rows, or to calculate difference over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LEAD()` allows you to retrieve the value of a column from the next row, while `LAG()` retrieves the value from the previous row.\n",

    "\n",
    "### `ROW_NUMBER()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ROW_NUMBER()` function is a fundamental window function that assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition, based on the specified ordering criteria. It provides a simple way to enumerate rows, which is particularly useful for ranking and pagination tasks. Each row receives a distinct number starting from 1 for the first row in the partition, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent row.\n",

The outer query uses the results from the inner subquery to rank films within each category based on their rental counts and finally filters for the top 3 films in each category. More specifically:\n",
    "- `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c.category_id ORDER BY COUNT(r.rental_id) DESC) AS rank`: This window function assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a category partition, ordered by the rental count in descending order. Each film within a category receives a rank based on its rental count, with the highest rental count receiving rank 1.\n",
    "- `WHERE rank <= 3`: Filters the results to include only the top 3 films within each category based on their rental counts. This ensures that only the most popular films in each category are selected."

    "- Window functions enable focused analysis within a specified range of rows in our dataset\n",
    "- Partitioning segments data into logical groups enabling separate computations within each group, which is particularly useful for comparative analyses across distinct categories or segments\n",
    "- Ordering arranges rows within partitions, ensuring that calculations and comparisons proceed in a structured manner, crucial for tasks like ranking or identifying trends\n",
    "- Framing specifies the window of rows for calculations, allowing for dynamic analysis over sliding windows of data, facilitating operations such as moving averages or identifying outliers\n",
    "- Aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN` can operate as window functions, enabling calculations like running totals and averages\n",
    "- `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns unique identifiers to rows within partitions, facilitating tasks such as pagination or ranking, ensuring consistent ordering of results\n",
    "- `LEAD()` and `LAG()` retrieve data from subsequent or preceding rows within partitions, providing contextual information for trend analysis or comparative assessments"
