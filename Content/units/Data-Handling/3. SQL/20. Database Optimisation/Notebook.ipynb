    "    - Optimisation enhances the performance of database operations, including data retrieval, insertion, update and deletion\n",
    "    - Improved performance leads to faster response time for queries, which is critical for applications with high user traffic or real-time processing requirements <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource Utilisation\n",
    "    - Optimised databases consume fewer resources such as CPU, memory and disk I/O\n",
    "    - Efficient resource utilisation allows the database to handle more concurrent users and transactions without experiencing performance degradation <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cost Reduction\n",
    "    - Optimised databases require fewer hardware resources, reducing upfront procurement costs, maintenance expenses, and energy consumption for both on-premises and cloud deployments <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability\n",

    "Subqueries, or nested queries, can often lead to inefficient execution plans, especially if they need to run multiple times for each row in the outer query. This can result in significant performance overhead. Instead, rewriting subqueries as joins can usually improve performance by allowing the database to use more efficient join algorithms and indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you have two tables: `orders` and `customers`. You want to retrieve all orders along with the total number of orders placed by each customer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    order_id, \n",
    "    customer_id,\n",
    "    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o2 WHERE o2.customer_id = orders.customer_id) AS total_orders\n",
    "FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the subquery `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o2 WHERE o2.customer_id = orders.customer_id` is correlated to the outer query, because it references a column from the outer query (`orders.customer_id`). In the case of correlated subqueries, the subquery is executed once for each row returned by the outer query. This is because the subquery depends on the results of the outer query and needs to be evaluated repeatedly for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in our example above, the subquery needs to be executed multiple times, once for each row in the `orders` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now used `JOIN` instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    orders.order_id,\n",
    "    orders.customer_id,\n",
    "    COUNT(customer_orders.order_id) AS total_orders\n",
    "FROM orders\n",
    "JOIN (\n",
    "    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders\n",
    "    FROM orders\n",
    "    GROUP BY customer_id\n",
    ") AS customer_orders ON orders.customer_id = customer_orders.customer_id\n",
    "GROUP BY orders.order_id, orders.customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this rewritten query, we first create a derived table, `customer_orders` using a subquery to calculate the total orders placed by each customer. Then, we join this derived table with the orders table based on the `customer_id column`. This offers better performance due to reduced repetitive calculations, optimised execution plans and improved index utilisation."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database optimisation improves query performance, decreases resource usage, and supports scalability, leading to cost savings\n",
    "- First Normal Form (1NF) ensures atomicity by requiring that each cell in the database table holds a single value, preventing the presence of multi-valued attributes\n",
    "- Second Normal Form (2NF) eliminates partial dependencies by ensuring that each non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key\n",
    "- Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates transitive dependencies, ensuring that all non-primary attributes are directly dependent only on the primary key\n",
    "- Indexes are utilized to improve query performance by allowing the database to locate data quickly without scanning the entire table, resulting in faster execution times\n",
    "- Avoiding the use of `SELECT *` statements reduces unnecessary data retrieval overhead by specifying only the required columns\n",
    "- The effective use of `WHERE` clause in queries improves performance by filtering records based on indexed columns\n",
    "- Optimizing joins involves preferring `INNER JOIN` over `OUTER JOIN` and ensuring join conditions are indexed\n",
    "- Avoiding subqueries can help prevent inefficient execution plans, especially when they need to run multiple times for each row in the outer queries. Instead, rewriting subqueries as joins typically improves performance by allowing the database to utilize more efficient join algorithms and indexes."
