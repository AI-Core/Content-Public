    "Creating CTEs begins with the `WITH` keyword followed by an alias `AS` for the CTE. You then wrap the query which will return your resultant set inside **parentheses**.

    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">Improving query performance</b>: In some cases, a CTE can improve query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the execution plan. This is especially true when the same subquery is repeated multiple times within a larger query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">Recursive queries</b>: CTEs can be used to perform recursive queries that are not possible with standard SQL queries. For example, you can use a CTE to traverse a tree structure or hierarchical data.\n",
