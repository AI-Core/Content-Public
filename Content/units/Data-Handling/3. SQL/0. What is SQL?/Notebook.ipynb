    "*SQL (Structured Query Language)* is a programming language that is designed for managing and manipulating data in *relational databases*. It is the standard language used for interacting with and querying *relational database management systems (RDBMS)*. The term \"relational\" in **relational databases** refers to the way in which the data is stored in a database, data is stored in tables within the database which have some \"\"relation\" between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is used to create and modify *database* *schema*, insert, update, delete, and query data stored in a **relational database**. With SQL, you can create tables, define their structure, set relationships between tables, and add or remove data from those tables. You can also filter and sort data based on specific criteria, aggregate data to summarize information, and perform various data manipulation and analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is used in a wide range of applications, including e-commerce websites, online banking systems, healthcare applications, and many others. Its simplicity and power have made it a popular choice among database administrators, data analysts, and developers."

    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">Efficient</b>: They use *normalization* so it doesn’t repeat its representation of data requiring less space\n",

    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">Robust</b>: Most databases have *ACID* compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ACID (*Atomicity*, *Consistency*, *Isolation*, and *Durability*)**, is a set of properties then ensures database reliability and consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Atomicity*</b>: Each statement in an SQL transaction is treated as a single unit.\n",
    "  Either the whole statement completes successful or the database state is rolled back to its previous state. This helps to prevent data loss or corruption.\n",
    "  - <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Consistency*</b>: All transactions will not violate the constraints placed on the database. If the database were to enter a corrupted state the current process will be aborted and the database will be rolled back to its previous state.\n",
    "  - <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Isolation*</b>: Even though multiple users appear to be reading and writing to the database at the same time each transaction is treated separately. There is a globally preserved queue and the result of one transaction will finish before a new one begins.  \n",
    "  - <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">*Durability*</b>: Ensuring that each change made to data by successfully executed statements are saved, even if the system fails.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, we might find some **downsides** when working with SQL databases:\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">Lower specificity</b>: Sometimes, SQL’s functionality is limited to what it can be\n",
    "programmed to do. This is not common, since its management systems get updated.\n",
    "- <b style=\"color: rgb(241, 90, 36)\">Limited Scalability</b>: Due to its strict schema requirements, this might be an impediment for scaling data\n",

    "*Cardinality*, the possible number of occurrences in **ONE** **entity** which is associated with the number of\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a special type of table which contains **foreign keys** which link to the **primary keys** in the tables being joined. Each row of the **junction table** represents the relationship between records in one of the tables being joined to the other. \n",

    "Let's take the example above. In this case students can sign up for **MANY** courses and a course can contain **MANY** students. \n",
    "We can call this event of signing up an **enrolment**, which requires an `ID` from the student table and an `ID` from the `course` table. So the `enrolment` table will act as the **junction table** saving the student `ID`'s and course `ID`'s. \n",
