# Motivation

- so you've got structured data in rows and columns in a database
- and you want to ask questions about the data

- to do that, you probably want to use SQL, often pronounced "sequel"

# What is SQL?

- SQL is the industry standard language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases, where any large volume of tabular data is typically stored
- simply put, it's for "talking to databases"
- it stands for structured query language, which pretty much tells you everything I've already mentioned

- and it looks something like this

_show a SQL query and explain "this query does X"_

- you can write queries which include different keywords, typically capitalised, which tell SQL what to do, and include different variables referring to your data, which tell SQL what to do it to

_Get exammples from [here](https://github.com/hpausiello/SQL-pagila-queries)_

_show a SQL query and explain "this query does Y"_

_show a SQL query and explain "this query does Z"_

- it can do much more than that
- and queries can get very complex

_Show monster query_

- but I wont get into that

# Flavours of SQL

- much like there are many spreadsheet applications, which all do pretty much the same thing, just with minor differences
- there are many flavours of SQL
- the most popular include
- oracle
- mysql
- microsoft SQL server
- postgres

- once you learn one, any others won't be a steep learning curve

- i'm using postgres here

# Outro

- and I'm going to teach you how to use it too!
