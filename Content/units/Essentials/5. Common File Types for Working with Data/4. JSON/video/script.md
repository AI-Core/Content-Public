<!-- KEY-VALUE PAIR DATA IS EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD -->
<!-- YOU MIGHT HAVE A USER ID AS A KEY, WHICH MAPS TO A COLLECTION OF ATTRIBUTES ABOUT THAT USER, WHICH MAKE UP THE VALUE -->
<!-- OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A BARCODE WHICH MAPS TO ATTRIBUTES OF A PRODUCT -->

<!-- JSON IS A FILE TYPE FOR STORING KEY VALUE PAIRS LIKE THIS -->

<!-- CONSISTS OF KEY VALUE PAIRS -->
<!-- MUCH LIKE A DICTIONARY DATA TYPE IN OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES WHICH YOU'LL SEE LATER -->

<!-- JSON CAN CONTAIN ANY KIND OF DATA -->

- and the data can be nested
  _explain nested structure of example_
  <!-- THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE JSON VALID is to turn it into a sequence of characters, that can be reconstructed into the original format -->
  <!-- we call this serialisation and deserialisation -->
  <!-- FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE WANTED TO SEND AN IMAGE OVER THE INTERNET AS JSON, WE WOULD HAVE TO SERIALISE THE IMAGE TO TURN IT INTO A SEQUENCE OF CHARACTERS -->
  <!-- THEN ON THE OTHER END WE COULD DECONSTRUCT IT -->
  <!-- if YOUR DATA CAN BE SERIALISED, IT CAN BE FORMATTED AS JSON -->

<!-- BECAUSE ALL JSON DATA JUST ENDS UP AS A SEQUENCE OF CHARACTERS, IT'S EASY TO SEND AND RECEIVE -->
<!-- BECAUSE OF THAT, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMMON STANDARD DATA FORMATS USED FOR SHARING DATA ACROSS THE INTERNET -->

- and that's actually what it was developed for too
- the main language for sending, recieving and manipulating data in a browser is javascript
- and that's where the name JSON comes from
- it stands for JavaScript Object Notation

<!-- OUTRO -->

- and now that you know about it, you're going to see it everywhere
