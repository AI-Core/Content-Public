It uses indentation instead of tags to represent nested structures, making it particularly easy for humans to read.

    "- **Human Readable**: It uses indentation instead of tags to represent nested structures, giving it a minimal format that is easy for humans to read and interpret, compared to alternatives such as `JSON` and `XML`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language Agnostic**: It can be used in conjunction with various programming languages like Python, Java, and Ruby\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Used by a Wide Range of Tools**: Various popular tools in data science, data engineering, DevOps and cloud engineering use `YAML` for configurations. Examples include Docker, Kubernetes, `Pytorch` and Conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimalism and Simplicity**: `YAML` deliberately opts for a minimalistic approach, avoiding the necessity for complex syntax and structures. This quality is not just about readability, but also about reducing the likelihood of errors and making it straightforward to write accurately, thus reducing the need for troubleshooting and debugging. \n",

    "\n",
    "YAML is notably strict with its syntax to preserve its simplicity and readability. Common syntax pitfalls include incorrect indentation, mishandling scalars, or misplacing dashes.\n",

    "  # Correct\n",
    "  person:\n",
    "    name: Jane\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Incorrect\n",
    "  person:\n",
    "  name: Jane\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Scalars**: Be mindful when using characters like `:` or `-` within scalars, as they might be misconstrued as key-value or list indicators respectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  # Correct\n",

    "\n",
    "  # Incorrect\n",
    "  sentence: Hello: World\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Data Type Mismatches\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect or unexpected data types can result in erroneous processing of your YAML file. The lack of explicit type definitions in YAML may sometimes lead to unintentional type inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quoting**: Ensure to quote scalars that might otherwise be inferred as different data types.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  # Correct\n",
    "  version: \"1.2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Incorrect\n",
    "  version: 1.2\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Boolean Representations**: Beware of values like `yes`, `no`, `true`, and `false`, which YAML recognises as booleans unless quoted.\n",

    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  # Correct\n",
    "  answer: \"yes\"\n",
