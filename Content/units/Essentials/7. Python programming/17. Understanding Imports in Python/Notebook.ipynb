    "\n",
    "- **Modular Code**: In programming, we often break down our code into smaller, self-contained pieces called *modules*. Think of these modules as individual tools in your programming toolbox. Each module serves a specific purpose or function within your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reuse**: Modular code promotes code reuse, much like how you use the same tool for different tasks in your toolbox. By creating reusable modules, you save time and effort because you don't have to write the same code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Smaller, well-organized modules are easier to understand, update, and debug. Just as a tidy toolbox makes your work more efficient, clean and modular code is easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Modular code also facilitates collaboration among developers. Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously, fostering teamwork and efficient development."
