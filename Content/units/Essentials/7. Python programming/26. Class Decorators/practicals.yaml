  name: Create a Temperature Class
  description: |+
    1. Create a Temperature class that has a constructor that takes a temperature in Celsius and stores it as an attribute.
    2. Add a method to convert the temperature of the instance to Fahrenheit
    3. Add a static method that converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
    4. Add a static method that check if a temperature is valid (i.e. between -273 and +3000)
    5. Add a class method that creates a new instance of the Temperature class given a temperature in Fahrenheit
    6. Add a class method named standard that creates a new instance of the Temperature class with a value of 0 Celsius
    7. Make the temperature attribute a property than can be set, get and deleted
    8. Use the dataclass decorator to substitute the constructor
