    1. Define two variables `num1`, and `num2` with the values 37 and 52 respectively
    2. What is the sum of num1 and num2? What about the product?
    3. Now reassign `num1` and `num2` to have the values 8 and 3 respectively
    4. Reuse the code to determine their sum and product

    1. Define a variable called `my_variable` and assign it the value 23
    2. Print the value of `my_variable`
    3. Write a new line of code that reassigns `my_variable` to have the value 98
    4. Print the value of `my_variable` again
    5. Notice that the value of `my_variable` has changed.

    1. Define the the following variables `num = 23`, `text_num = “57”` and `decimal_num = 98.3`
    2. Print the types of each variable (hint: use the `type()` function)
    3. What happens when you add `num` and `decimal_num`? What about `num` and `text_num`?
    4. You can change the type of the string `text_num` to an integer by using the `int()` function. Try it out!
    5. What happens when you change `text_num` to an integer and add it to `num`?
