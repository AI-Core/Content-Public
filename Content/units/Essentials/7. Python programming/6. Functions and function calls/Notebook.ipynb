    "## What are Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or operation. Functions are used to organize code and make it more reusable, efficient, and easier to read and understand. Functions can be called or invoked from other parts of the program, and they can be reused multiple times with different inputs or arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call refers to the action of invoking or executing a function. When a function is called, the program control is transferred to the function, and the code inside the function is executed. A function call typically consists of the function name, followed by a set of parentheses that may contain arguments or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental idea here is that a function is defined once, and then can be re-used many times in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have learned that the main idea behind functions is that we can write some instructions once, and then re-use them many times elsewhere in our code. The function call handles the re-use part, and its counterpart is the function defnition, which is the block of code which tells us what the function does and how it behaves.\n",

You can either specify the arguments in the order in which the parameters are listed, which will map them automatically, or you can specify them explicitly by assigning them directly with the `=` operator."

But what if we wanted to do someting with the answer afterwards? The `return` statement of a function lists the variables of the function that will be returned in the function's output. To use those variables outside the function, we can return them to one or more output variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the code inside the function is isolated from the rest of the script. Variables defined inside the fucntion are only visible when the program control is inside the function. You cannot use them outside. This concept is known as the function's scope. You don't need to worry about this too much right now, as we will cover it in much more detail later, but for now, just remember that if we want to use something we have generated inside a function, we need to `return` it as an output, and assign it to a variable outside of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function in the code block below takes in an integer, and returns two Boolean variables, letting us know whether the number is even, and whether it is a perfect square. We can assign both of these to output variables when we call the function, by listing two output variables, separated by commas, and then assigning the function's outputs with an `=` sign."
