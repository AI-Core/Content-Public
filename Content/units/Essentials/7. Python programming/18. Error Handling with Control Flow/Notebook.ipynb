    "Exception handling is a vital aspect of programming that allows you to manage and respond to unexpected events, known as *exceptions*, that can occur during the execution of your code. An exception is an abnormal condition or error that disrupts the normal flow of your program. It could be caused by factors such as invalid input, division by zero, file not found, or network errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of exception handling is to gracefully handle these exceptions and prevent them from causing program crashes or undesired behavior. By employing error handling techniques, you can detect and respond to exceptions in a controlled manner, enhancing the reliability and robustness of your code."

    "## Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your journey of learning about error handling with control flow in programming! Let's explore the key reasons why learning about error handling is valuable:\n",
    "- **Handling Unexpected Situations**: Error handling helps your program handle unexpected situations or problems that may happen. It's like having a backup plan to deal with things that go wrong while your program is running. This makes your program stronger and more able to handle different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keeping the Program Running**: Error handling gives you control over what happens when something goes wrong. By using special code structures like `try`-`except`, you can catch errors and decide what to do instead. It's like having a safety net that prevents your program from crashing and allows it to keep running even if it encounters errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finding and Fixing Problems**: Error handling helps you find and fix problems in your program. When errors occur, you can get helpful information about what went wrong, like error messages or logs. This makes it easier to understand and solve the problems."

    "Key concepts related to exception handling include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exception**\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, resulting in the disruption of the normal flow of code. Exceptions can be caused by various factors, such as runtime errors, invalid input, or external factors like file or network operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception Types \n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python are organized into different types or classes, each representing a specific category of error. Common exception types include `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`, among others. By handling specific exception types, you can provide targeted responses and error messages for different exceptional scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we have already seen a lot of examples of different exceptions so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Try-Except Block\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try`-`except` block is a fundamental construct in exception handling that allows you to capture and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of a specific section of code. It provides a structured way to catch and respond to exceptions, preventing them from causing program crashes or undesired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the `try`-`except` block is as follows:"

    "Here's how the `try`-`except` block works:\n",
    "- The code that may raise an exception is enclosed within the `try` block. This section typically contains code that has the potential to encounter errors, such as accessing external resources, performing calculations, or parsing user input.\n",
    "- If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution of that block is immediately interrupted, and the program flow jumps to the corresponding `except` block. The `except` block specifies the type of exception it can handle by using the `ExceptionType` placeholder.\n",
    "- The `except` block contains the code that handles the exception. It provides an opportunity to respond to the exception by performing appropriate actions, displaying error messages, or taking corrective measures.\n",
    "- If an exception of the specified `ExceptionType` occurs, the corresponding `except` block is executed. If the exception does not match the specified type, it propagates up the call stack to find a suitable `except` block or, if none is found, it causes the program to terminate.\n",

    "- By using specific exception types in `except` blocks, you can handle different types of exceptions differently, allowing for more targeted error handling\n",
    "- The `finally` block is an optional part of the `try`-`except` structure. It is used to define code that should be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used for cleanup tasks and releasing resources.\n",
