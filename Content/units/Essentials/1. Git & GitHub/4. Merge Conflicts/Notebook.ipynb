    "## Causes of Merge Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "The main causes of merge conflicts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edit Conflicts**: This is the most common type of merge conflict. It happens when changes are made on the same line of the same file on different branches. When you attempt to merge these branches, git cannot determine which change should take precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delete/Edit Conflicts**: These occur when one branch deletes a file while another branch modifies the same file. Upon attempting to merge, git is unsure whether to keep the file or delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rename/Edit Conflicts**: These conflicts happen when a file is renamed in one branch and modified in another. git becomes confused because the renamed file appears to be a new file, and the other branch still has changes related to the old file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Binary Files**: git cannot merge binary files (like images, Jupyter notebooks, compiled code  etc.). If two branches modify the same binary file and are then merged, git will not know how to combine these changes and will raise a conflict.\n",

    "## Identifying Merge Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "git provides clear indicators when a merge conflict occurs. When you attempt a merge operation and git encounters conflicting changes, it will halt the merge and output a message indicating that conflicts need to be resolved. This message will typically look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Auto-merging filename\n",
    "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in filename\n",
    "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/conflict_msg.png width=700></p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, git marks the areas in your files where conflicts occurred with conflict markers. These conflict markers show you the conflicting changes so that you can resolve them. They look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "<<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "[Changes made in the current branch]\n",
    "=======\n",
    "[Changes made in the branch to be merged]\n",
    ">>>>>>> branch-name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what this message looks like in VSCode:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/merge_resolve2.png width=700></p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The area between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` shows the changes from the branch you have currently checked out (`HEAD`), while the area between `=======` and `>>>>>>> branch-name` shows the changes coming from the branch you are trying to merge into your current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "When git outputs a conflict message, it's communicating where the problem occurred and which files are affected:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Auto-merging` part of the message indicates which file git tried to automatically merge changes into\n",
    "- The `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in filename` part tells you that a conflict was found in that file\n",
    "- The `Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.` section is instructing you to manually resolve the conflict and then make a new commit\n",
