    "> A *Pull Request*, often abbreviated to *PR*, is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch to another in GitHub. They provide a mechanism to propose, review, and integrate changes to a codebase in a collaborative manner. Typically, you will be working on a new feature by pushing changes to a dedicated branch. Then when you are ready to integrate them into main, you would raise a **PR** in the upstream branch (eg. `main`) to integrate these changes."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull Requests are an essential tool in team-based software projects for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Review:** PRs make it easy for others on the team to review the code changes before they're integrated into the main codebase. This ensures code quality and consistency, helps spot potential bugs, and can lead to more robust solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** PRs provide a forum for team members to discuss proposed changes, suggest modifications, or ask for clarifications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Permissions:** PRs allow the repository owner to permit collaboration while retaining control over who gets to merge, by setting permissions in the repo accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traceability:** Each PR is associated with a set of changes and a discussion thread, providing a documented history of changes made to the codebase and the rationale behind them. This can be invaluable for understanding the project's evolution or debugging issues in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Many projects use automated testing tools that are triggered whenever a PR is created. These tools run a suite of tests against the changes and provide a status check, ensuring that the proposed changes don't break existing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding Direct Commits:** Directly committing to the `main` branch can be risky, especially in production projects. PRs help prevent this by necessitating that changes be proposed, reviewed, and approved before they're integrated."

    "\n",
    "- **Branch Protection Rules:** In GitHub, repository admins can set up protected branch rules. These can include things like requiring status checks to pass, requiring PRs to be up-to-date with the target branch, requiring linear history, or requiring specific people to review the changes. If the PR doesn't meet any of these rules, it won't be able to be merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The `WIP` Keyword:** PRs can be denoted a work in progress, using the `WIP` keyword in the PR title. This will prevent merging until it is removed. It is used to generate a PR to allow people to track and comment on changes during development, without the risk of someone accidentally merging it."

    "## Merge Conflicts and Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolving merge conflicts associated with a pull request is a little more complicated than for standard merges, because the final merge of the comparison branch into the **base** branch can only happen once the PR itself is ready to be completed, and this will not be possible while merge conflicts still exist. For example, if you were attempting to merge a branch called  `feature` into `main`, you would have to pull the changes from the **base branch** into the **compare branch** and resolve any conflicts before merging. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works fine for a simple workflow where a feature branch is checked out from `main` and then merged back into `main` by raising a PR. However in a commercial setting, it will usually be necessary to merge the feature branch with several different branches. For example you might have a `dev` (development) branch, which is used to test out new features and a `staging` branch which is used as a pre-production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation it would not work to pull the **base** branch into the comparison branch, as for example pulling `dev` into `feature` would contaminate the `feature` branch with all the commits from `dev`, which would cause problems if you later wanted to merge the branch into `staging`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To get around this issue, it is customary to use what is known as a *sacrificial branch*, in other words a duplicate copy of the feature branch that is only used for the purpose of resolving a merge conflict, and then discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example to make this more concrete.\n",
    "\n",

    "# This line in main will create a merge conflict \n",
