    "## Commits are Arranged into Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Commits are the core building block units of a git project timeline. Each time you make a commit, it is added to a chain of previous commits, each with its own unique identifier, known as a *SHA-1 hash*. The commit hash that is automatically generated for each commit you make. This 40-character string of numbers and letters is created by applying the SHA-1 algorithm to the contents and metadata of the commit, ensuring a unique identifier for each commit. \n",
    "\n",
    ">A sequential history of commits is known as a *branch*, and looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/commit_branch.png width=900></p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each box represents a commit (labelled with the first few digits of the SHA-1 hash), and the arrows represent the commit history. We will see more graphs like this as we go through the lesson and explain more advanced concepts.\n",

    "## Using Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first start working in a new repository, there is only a single branch. This branch is called `main` (or `master` in earlier versions) by default, and forms the primary, production version of your project. Reverting to earlier commits in the branch effectively functions as an \"undo\", reverting to earlier stages in the development of your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> The real power of git however comes from using multiple branches. A branch is chain of commits that forms a parallel version of a repository. It is an independent line of development that allows you to isolate your work without affecting the `main` branch. Technically, a branch is just a movable pointer to a commit, as well will see later in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a branch, you're effectively creating a unique environment where you can experiment, make changes, or add new features. Once you're satisfied with your updates, you can *merge* your branch back into the main branch, bringing over your modifications. We will learn more about merging branches later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using branches, you can:\n",
    "- Work on new features separate from other developers\n",
    "- Ensure that the development process is structured and easy to follow\n",
    "- Test out experimental/work-in-progress (WIP) code without altering the `main` branch\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature-Based Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "*Feature-based workflow* is an approach to coding where each new feature, bug fix, or unit of work is developed in a separate branch. The idea is to isolate changes related to a specific feature from the rest of the project. This helps to prevent introducing bugs into the `main` branch and makes it easier to manage code for larger projects, especially when several developers are collaborating on the same project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to worry too much about the details here, just remember that each time you want to add a new feature, you should create a new branch.\n"

    "## The `HEAD` Pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "In git, `HEAD` is a reference (or a pointer) to the latest commit in the currently active branch. So, if you switch from one branch to another, the `HEAD` will point to the latest commit of the new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the `HEAD` as the \"current commit\". It's also important when you're looking to revert changes, as you'll often revert to the commit that `HEAD` points to. In essence, `HEAD` is a way for git to know which commit is the currently active one, and where you are in your project history."

    "You can create a new branch using either the `git branch` or `git checkout` commands. *Checking out* is git speak for switching from one branch to another. This can be between existing branches, or to a new branch that doesn't exist yet. To create a new branch we need to used the `-b` flag for the `checkout` command, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout -b my_new_feature_branch`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `git branch BRANCH_NAME`, the difference being that `checkout -b` creates the branch **and** checks it out (switches to the branch), whereas `git branch` only creates the branch, but leaves you on the existing branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever forget which branch you are currently on, you can find out by using the `git branch` command with no arguments. This will display a list of all branches in the repo, with the current branch highlighted.\n",
