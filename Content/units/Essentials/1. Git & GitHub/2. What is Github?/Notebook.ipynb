    "## Motivation\n",
    "GitHub's comprehensive suite of features takes the version control that git offers and extends it to a collaborative, cloud-based environment, creating a platform for developers to share, improve, and showcase their work. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Free Hosting and Storage:** GitHub provides free hosting and storage for your code repositories, making it an affordable option for individuals and small teams\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration:** It's designed for team collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and seamlessly merge their changes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed Architecture:** As a cloud-based platform, GitHub ensures there's no single point of failure - you don't need to worry about data loss due to issues like a local hard drive failure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portfolio Showcase:** Many developers and data professionals use GitHub as a \"shop window\" to showcase their coding projects, demonstrating their skills to peers and potential employers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Additional Features:** Beyond git's core functionality, GitHub offers a host of extra features, including issue tracking, project management tools, and automated testing workflows, to name a few"

We will learn more about these concepts later. *Private* repositories can only be viewed by the creator, or by collaborators that are added by the creator.\n",

We will learn a lot more about how to structure these in another lesson, but for now you can just tick the box to create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.gitignore` File\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, git will track any file inside the repository folder. However there may be some files that you do not want to accidentally stage and commit, and which you would like to tell git to avoid tracking under any circumstances. Situations where this might apply include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Secrets and credentials:** Any file that contains sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, or cryptographic keys, should not be tracked in git to avoid these secrets becoming public. It's often better to use environment variables or other secure means to handle this type of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compiled source code:** Files that are produced as the result of a build or compile process, such as `.o`, `.pyc` or `.exe` files, should typically be ignored because they are generated locally from the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operating system and editor-specific files:** Files that are specific to your operating system or text editor, like `.DS_Store` files on macOS don't usually belong in version control and should be added to `.gitignore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Databases or large data folders:** These are typically not required for a project's source code, and so should be added to `.gitignore`. A repository should generally be kept under 1 GB in size to avoid performance issues and potentially warnings from GitHub. There is also an upper size limit of 100 MB for individual files. For this reason, it is better to keep your repository to just your source code, and host any datasets elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Avoid Revealing Sensitive Information\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: from time to time in the course, you will be asked to make use of API keys, which are a way of authenticating your permission to use a software service. It is very important that you remember to add these to your `.gitignore ` file. GitHub may even block your commits if you expose API keys, or they may inform the API key issuer of the breach and arrange for the key to be revoked. We will learn more about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) later in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have your repository set to public, anyone on the internet can view its contents. For this reason it's incredibly important to avoid uploading sensitive information such as usernames and passwords, or API keys or tokens. If information like this is needed to make your code run, then it should be stored in a file in your local repository, and this file should be added to your `.gitignore`. Never hard-code passwords or keys into your scripts. Even if your repository is set to private, it can be changed to public at a later date, and it is better not to have to remember to handle these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `.gitignore` Defaults\n",

When you choose to make your repository public, you also need to select a license to go with it, otherwise others have no permission to use your code. You should consider your intentions for the project's use and how open you want it to be for collaboration. Here are some of the popular license types you can use:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Apache License 2.0:** A permissive license similar to the MIT license but also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users\n",

    "\n",
    "You can add any files you want to include in your `.gitignore` on a new line in the file. Directories are added the same way, but additionally need to be followed by a `/`. Comments can also be added by prefixing the line with a `#`, just like in Python. If you selected a `.gitignore` template when creating the repo, your file might already contain some standard entries describing files that should typically be ignored for the programming language you are using. If so, just add your changes to the bottom of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/after_ignore.png width=700></p><br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pushing Changes to the Remote Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have updated our `.gitignore` file locally, we'd like those changes to be reflected in the main repository. To do so, we can stage it using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add .gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "And then commit the changes using `git commit`. Remember to add a commit message, explaining what changes are in this commit!\n",

    "#### 1. Pushing a New Branch\n",

    "This issue occurs if you create a new branch locally which does not yet exist on the repo, and you want to push it to the remote repository for the first time. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create a new branch of `my_test_repo` using the command `git checkout -b my_new_branch`\n",
    "2. Create a new text file using the command `touch new_textfile.txt`\n",
    "3. Stage and commit the new file\n",

    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/new_branch_push.png width=700></p><br>\n",

    "The solution here is actually provided in the feedback you receive from attempting `git push`:\n",

    "`git push --set-upstream origin my_new_branch`\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/pull_rebase.gif width=900></p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--set-upstream` option links your local branch to its corresponding remote branch on your GitHub repository, allowing git to know where future pushes for the branch should be directed. This command needs to be used only once for each branch, as git will remember the setting for subsequent pushes and pulls. \n",

    "#### 2. Remote Branch is Ahead of Local Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue occurs when there are commits on the remote branch that are not reflected in the local repository. When the remote branch is ahead of your local branch, git will reject your push because it could overwrite commits on the remote branch. This is to prevent potential loss of work that exists on the remote repository but hasn't been pulled into the local repository yet. This often happens to new GitHub users when they edit their `README.md` on their remote repository, and subsequently make changes on to their local repository and attempt to push them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recreate this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your remote repository and add some text to the `README.md` and commit the changes to the main branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/add_remote_text.gif width=800></p><br>\n",

    "Before you can push your changes, you need to integrate the new commits from the remote branch into your local branch. You typically do this using `git pull`, which fetches the changes from the remote repository and then merges them into your current branch. We will learn a lot more about this in a later lesson, but in this situation you can fix this error using the command:\n",

    "\n",
    "In a previous lesson we learned about editing the most recent commit using the `git commit --amend` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "When pushing amended commits, it is important to keep in mind that `git commit --amend` actually creates a new commit with a new ID and replaces the most recent commit with it. When you try to push this new commit to a remote repository, git sees that the commit you're trying to push doesn't directly follow the most recent commit in the repository. It appears to git as if you're missing some commits in your local history, or as if you're trying to overwrite the existing history of the repository. So, git will prevent the push to avoid potentially losing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><p align=center><img src=images/git_amend.gif width=800></p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you've already pushed your commit to a remote repository, and then you amend it, you'll have to force push with `git push --force`. This command tells git that you're aware of what you're doing and you want to overwrite the history in the remote repository with your local history. In the case of amending a commit, `git push --force` is usually safe, because you're intentionally rewriting the most recent commit. It should not be used to override other types of error message unless you know exactly what you are doing, as it can create conflicts or cause work to be lost.\n",
