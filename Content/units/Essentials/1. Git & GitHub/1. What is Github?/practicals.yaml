- description: '1. Add a new `print` statement to the `test.py` file

    2. Add it to staging

    3. Oh no that was actually a mistake! I didn''t mean for you to actually stage it on this branch, now we need to reset our staging area.

    4. Use `git reset` to reset the staging area

    5. Make a new branch called `important-feature-branch`

    6. Make a file called `test.txt` and add text on the first line

    7. Switch back to `main` (don''t merge the changes yet)

    8. Make another branch called `another-feature-branch` and move onto that branch using `git checkout another-feature-branch`

    9. Make ANOTHER different file called `test.txt` (we''re trying to cause a merge conflict)

    10. Add and commit the change to this branch

    11. Now merge `important-feature-branch` into `another-feature-branch` (which branch does that mean you need to run the command from?). You should get a merge conflict in that file where incompatible changes have been made

    12. Fix the conflict by editing the file and removing the chevrons (<<<<<<<<) and the content that you want to delete. You can keep both versions if you like, but you''ll still need to remove the chevrons.

    13. Commit the fix

    14. Merge the changes into the main branch
