    "## Standard Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard streams are pre-connected input and output communication channels between a computer program and its environment. In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, there are three standard streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Standard Input (stdin)*: This is the stream from which a program reads its input. By default, this is the keyboard.\n",
    "- *Standard Output (stdout)*: This is the stream to which a program writes its output data. By default, this is the computer's screen.\n",
    "- *Standard Error (stderr)*: This is another output stream typically used by programs to output error messages or diagnostics. It is also displayed on the computer's screen by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying Standard Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard streams can be modified by various operators. We have already met the `>` operator, which redirects the standard output stream of a program to a file, and its counterpart  `>>`, the append output redirection. There are numerous other operators in Unix systems, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redirect Input (`<`)\n",
    " The `<` operator redirects a file to standard input. For instance, if you have a program that takes input from the user, you could use `<` to feed it a file of input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you have a simple program called `print_input.sh`, which usually waits for user input and then prints what is typed in.\n",
    "You could redirect the contents of a text file to it using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "print_input.sh < my_textfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/redirect_input.png\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redirect Error (`2>`)\n",
    "This operator redirects the standard error (stderr) to a file, replacing the current contents of the file. It works similarly to `>`, but with error messages instead of standard output. Like the redirect stdout (`>`) command, it has a counterpart `2>>` which appends the error stream to the file rather than overwriting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could log failed attempts to list nonexistent directories using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls nonexistentdirectory 2>> errors.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/redirect_error.png\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Here Document or Heredoc Operator (`<<`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This operator tells the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only a specific delimiter is seen. All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example using the cat command, waiting for an `EOF` (end of file) delimiter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat << EOF\n",
    "Hello,\n",
    "This is a here document.\n",
    "EOF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any delimiter you like, but take care to choose one that might appear in the body of the file you wish to read, otherwise the read command might terminate prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Here String (`<<<`)\n",
    "This operator, known as a here string, is used to redirect a string of text into the standard input of a command. \n",
    "For example, `wc -l <<< \"Hello world\"` will count the number of lines in the string `\"Hello world\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/heredoc.png\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",

    "### The Pipe `|` Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The *pipe operator* (`|`) is another operator that modifies the standard stream. In this case it is used to route `stdout` of one command to the `stdin` of another. This is a powerful and versatile feature, as it allows you to compose chains of commands, each of which modify the output of another. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you have a directory of log files, and you want to count the number of times the phrase \"Error 404\" appears in it. We could use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat *.log | grep 'Error 404' | wc -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `cat *.log` concatenates all the files that end with the `.log` extension and displays them in the terminal\n",
    "- `grep 'Error 404'` uses the `grep` command to search for any lines containing \"Error 404\", filters the output to contain just those lines\n",
    "- `wc -l` counts the number of lines and returns the count\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe operators string all of these commands together, to give the final result.\n",

    "## Text Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Although most of the time you will edit files inside a CLI text editor like `nano`, it can often be useful to perform some quick operations on text files directly in the shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this would be searching through a log file for a particular phrase, or quickly extracting a list of email addresses from an unstructured text file. Although individual shell commands only tend to do a single job, when chained together with the `|` pipe command they can perform quite advanced operations quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Searching Inside Files\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes useful to be able to search quickly through a file's contents from the command line. To achieve this, we can use the `grep` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "The name `grep` stands for \"global regular expression print,\" which provides a hint to its primary function: it searches the input files for lines that match a *regular expression*, which is a term for a specific pattern of characters that defines a string that you want to find a perfect or partial match to. When a line matches the regular expression, `grep` prints it to the standard output. It's an indispensable tool for searching through large amounts of text, logs, or code quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions themselves are quite a complex topic, beyond the scope of this guide, but at their simplest, they can just be a phrase you want to match. For example if we wanted to find a match for the phrase \"Error 404\" in a log file called `logfile.txt`, we could just use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "grep 'Error 404' 12.log\n",
    "```\n",

By default, sort operates on files, taking a file name as input, sorting the lines in the file, and outputting the sorted list to the terminal. If no file is specified, sort reads from standard input. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pipe output from other commands into sort. For example,`ls | sort` will list all files in the current directory in alphabetical order. \n",

    "## Shell Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as executing commands directly in the terminal, it is possible to write them to a *shell script*. A shell script is essentially a text file that contains a series of commands. Shell scripts are interpreted, not compiled: the CLI reads commands from the script line by line and executes them the same way it would if the commands were typed directly into the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example of a shell script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a comment. The script starts here:\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The line `#!/bin/bash` is called a *hash-bang* or *Shebang*. It is a special line that specifies the interpreter for executing the script. In this case, the script is to be executed using bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comments are lines that are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to describe the function of the script and are denoted by the `#` symbol at the start of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script, you'd need to save it to a file (say, `hello_world.sh`), give it executable permissions with `chmod +x hello_world.sh`, and then you can run it with `./hello_world.sh`. The output will be:\n",
