    "\n",
    "### Unix (Mac or Linux) Systems\n",

    "\n",
    "The first line tells you when you were last logged in, and the line below it is the command prompt. The prompt tells you a few pieces of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It lets you know which virtual environment you are running, if any. That is the information in parentheses`()`. You will learn about virtual environments like `conda` elsewhere in the course, so don't worry about this too much for now!\n",
    "- It tells you which user is currently logged in on the machine. Here `timhowe@Tims-MBP` - `Tim` is the username, and `Tims-MBP` is the name of the machine.\n",
    "- It lets you know which directory you are in. Currently this screen is showing we are in the `home` directory, which has the shorthand of `~` on Unix systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Mac this is by default in the `users` directory, in a subfolder named after the username. So in this instance it would be `users/timhowe`. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux systems, the default home directory for a user is typically located in the `/home` directory and is named after the username. For example, if your username is `user1`, your home directory would be `/home/user1`. For the root user (a special user account with unrestricted privileges and administrative rights), the home directory is typically `/root`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prompt symbol itself. On Zsh this is `%`, while on bash it is `$`. This just lets you know that the terminal is awaiting user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were in a different directory, it would show the name of the current directory.\n",

    "The prompt line doesn't tell you quite as much in Unix terminals, but you can see the current directory, followed by a `>` symbol, and a flashing cursor indicating the terminal is awaiting user input. The default home directory is a subdirectory of `C:/Users` , named after the user's username.\n",

    "## File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "> The term *file path* refers to the specific location of a file or a directory in the file system. It provides a way to navigate through the hierarchical structure of a computer's file system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a file path:\n",
    "\n",
    "`/home/user/documents/my_textfile.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is composed of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Root Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The root directory is the base directory of your file system. In Unix-like systems, this is typically represented by a forward slash (`/`). In Windows, it's typically represented by a drive letter followed by a colon and a backslash, eg. `C:\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Directories and Subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the folders within the file system. Each folder is separated by a slash (`/`) in Unix-like systems or a backslash (`\\`) in Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In general, the term *parent directory* or `parent folder` is used to mean the directory above the current directory, and *child directory* or *subdirectory* are used to describe a folder inside the current folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A set of folders inside each other are said to be *nested*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in `/home/user/documents`, `home`, `user`, and `documents` are directories, each nested inside the previous one. `home` is the parent of `user`, and `documents` is the child of `user`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. File Name\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the name of the file at the end of the file path. For instance, in `/home/user/documents/my_textfile.txt`, `my_textfile.txt` is the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.File Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the part of the file name after the last dot, which typically indicates the file type. In `my_textfile.txt`, `txt` is the file extension, in this case indicating that it's a text file. Don't worry about not knowing much about file types now, we will cover them later in the course.\n",

    "## Absolute and Relative Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "A file path can be either absolute or relative. \n",
    "\n",
    "> An *absolute* path starts from the root directory and specifies the exact location of a file or directory. A *relative* path, on the other hand, starts from the current working directory. It uses `.` to represent the current directory, and `..` to represent the parent directory. You can also specify any child directory by just using its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- A directory might have the absolute path of `home/user/documents`\n",
    "- If your current directory is `/home/user`, the relative path to `documents` would be `./documents` (or simply `documents`)\n",
    "- The relative path to `home` would be `..`\n"

    "### The `~` Shortcut\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Unix-like operating systems, the tilde (`~`) character is a shortcut that represents the home directory of the current user. This is usually a directory named after the user under the `/home` directory in Linux, or in `/Users` on a Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you have a user named `user1`, typing `cd ~` or simply `cd` will change the working directory to `/home/user1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access other users' home directories using the tilde as well. If you have a user named `user2`, `~user2` would refer to the home directory of `user2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This usage of the tilde to represent the home directory is a feature provided by the shell, and not the underlying filesystem or operating system. This means that it might not be recognized in all contexts outside of a shell command line, such as in a programming language that interacts with the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Filepaths Containing Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The space character in terminal commands is used to separate arguments to a command, so for this reason, spaces in directory names can cause issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the directory name `~/Important Documents` would be read as two arguments \"Important\" and \"Documents\". It is therefore best practice to avoid using spaces in directory names, and instead use a `_` or `-` character to separate words. \n",
    "\n",
    "> If you do have spaces in your directory names though, you can enclose them in single (`'`) or double (`\"`) quotes on Windows, or use backslash (`\\`) before the empty space in Unix-based systems to avoid the issue."

    "## Finding your Current Directory Path\n",
    "\n",
    "> From here onwards in the course, we will only be providing instructions for Unix-type terminals that run Bash or Zsh. Windows users will be able to use the same commands when using Bash for Windows / GitBash, except in specific circumstances that we will detail.\n",

    "If you type `ls -a`, it will also list hidden files. The `-a` here is a parameter of the `ls` function, which modifies its behaviour from the default. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most terminal commands will have parameters like this which can be used to alter their behaviour. For example, [this](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/ls1.html) is the list of all of the available parameters for `ls` in Bash. The link shows the text of the *man page* for the `ls` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "A man page (short for manual page) is a form of software documentation that can be viewed in a terminal, containing detailed information about a command or software utility in a Unix-based operating system. To view the man page of any function, just use the `man` command, followed by the name of the function. For example `man ls`.\n",

    "## Changing Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "On Unix systems using Bash or Zsh, the command for moving from one directory to another is `cd`, followed by the name of the directory you wish to change to. If the directory you want to change to is inside the current working directory, you can just type the directory name.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To change to a directory elsewhere in the directory structure, you will need to type its full (absolute) path. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you are currently in the `Documents` folder, and you want to change to a directory called `Photos` located inside the `Pictures` folder, which is in the `Home` directory. You will then need to use the following command `cd /Home/Pictures/Photos`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To go up a level to the parent folder of your current directory, use the command `cd ..`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you are currently in a directory called `Photos` inside the `Pictures` folder, and you want to navigate to the parent folder `Pictures`. You could do so using the `cd ..` command.\n",
