    "# What is the Command Line?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The *command line* is a place on your computer where you can type in specific instructions, or \"commands\", to tell your computer what to do. The way a computer functions is governed by a large, complex program called an operating system (OS), like Windows or Linux. The command line is one of the ways you can interact with the operating system and give it tasks to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the command line you only use text-based instructions, no pictures or buttons. You use it through a program called a *command line interface* (CLI). This is different from the usual way of clicking on icons and menus, which is known as a *graphical user interface* (GUI). \n",
    "\n",
    "The command line provides a more direct way of interacting with an operating system and its applications. It can be more efficient than a GUI for certain tasks, especially for system administration or for automating tasks through scripts. In short, instead of clicking around with your mouse, you're typing instructions for your computer."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should we learn to use the command line when operating systems have an easy-to-understand graphical interface? Well, even though the graphical interface is great for everyday tasks, the command line has some advantages that are really helpful for technical work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automation and Efficiency**: With the command line, we can create scripts that let us write a set of commands once and then use them over and over again. This saves time and automates repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More Control and Precision**: The command line gives us more options and control over tasks, especially complicated ones\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning and Understanding**: Using the command line can help you understand how computers and operating systems work, which is useful for fixing solving problems. Also, while operating system GUIs can change with nearly every version update, the command line will usually be the same, so you will know your way around. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Consumption**: The command line uses less computer power than GUIs. This can be important on systems with limited resources or when running intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You'll Feel Like a 1990s Hacker**: Remember those movies where text scrolled down the screen like a hacker? Well, using the command line can give you that nostalgic feeling. On a more serious note, once you become accustomed to the command line, you might actually prefer it over the graphical interface for many tasks."

    "\n",
    "You interact with the command line using a *terminal* or *console window*, known as a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> How to access the CLI varies  between different operating systems, with each having its own terminal window. There are also slight differences in terms of the specific commands and syntax that can be used in the operating system - the instructions that you can use to control it.\n",

    "\n",

    "## The CLI and Shell Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "A *shell* in computing is a user interface that allows you to interact with the operating system. Shells can be graphical (like the GUI), but the term \"shell\" typically refers to a CLI, and the scripting language used to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bash (Bourne Again Shell)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash is the default shell for most Unix-like systems, such as Linux and older versions of macOS. Bash is a successor to the Bourne Shell (sh), adding many useful features like command line editing, shell scripting capabilities, and command history.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unix-like systems refer to operating systems that share similarities with the original Unix operating system. Unix itself was developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs and became widely used in the computing industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix-like systems include various operating systems that adopt similar design principles and features inspired by Unix. Some popular examples of Unix-like systems are Linux and MacOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zsh (z-shell)\n",
    "\n",
    "Zsh is another shell for Unix-like systems. It includes all features of Bash, but adds many of its own. Some of these additional features include better auto-completion, command correction, and a more customizable interface. As of macOS Catalina, zsh is the default shell on macOS, replacing Bash. It has extremely similar syntax to Bash. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PowerShell\n",
    "PowerShell is a shell developed by Microsoft for use in Windows systems. It's more powerful and complex than the older Windows Command Prompt. It can do most of the same things as Bash or Zsh, but the syntax is very different.  For example, to remove a file in Bash/Zsh you would use `rm filename`, whereas in PowerShell it would be `Remove-Item filename`. However in many cases the PowerShell commands have built-in aliases (other names for the same command) that map to common Unix commands, which allows you to use familiar command names if you are more used to a Unix-based system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For the purposes of this course, we recommend that Windows users install and use Bash for Windows, rather than using the PowerShell. You might hear it said that software developers don't like or use Windows. This could not be further from the truth, especially in the past decade. However, various tools that you are likely to need, including the popular software versioning system will either be unable to use Powershell, or will not be optimised for it. It is also the case that while PowerShell knows the majority of Unix CLI commands, the reverse is not the case! You are likely to encounter a lot of machines in your career that require the use of Unix Shell commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install Bash on your machine, we recommend you download and install Git for Windows. Git is a version control system that helps you save different versions of your work, like drafts of a document, so you can easily revisit or restore earlier versions if needed. We will learn a lot more about git later in the course, but for now all you need to know is that the installation comes with a Windows version of Bash that you can use to follow along with this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Git for Windows, click on this [link](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and download the latest 64-bit version. Then run the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the installation, search for Search for `Git Bash` in your start menu and open the application.\n",

    "## Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "> Commands are programs that allow us to do basic tasks in our operating systems. Entering commands is the main purpose of the CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands have the following general form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "command [-short_flags] [--long_flags] [arguments]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a CLI, a line at the bottom of the screen is used to enter commands. A command is activated when you press the **Enter** key. The system executes the command and typically displays its output on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `command`\n",
    "\n",
    "This refers to the name of the command, e.g. `ls` which lists the files in the current directory.  Following the command name, we can type various parameters and arguments, each of which are separated by spaces. Don't worry about not being familiar with any commands so far, we will learn all about them in future lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags are parameters which modify the behaviour of a command. Each command has its own set of options, and each option can be turned on by using the relevant flag. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flags can be used in one of two ways:\n",
    "    - Implicit (short, `-a`)\n",
    "    - Explicit (long, `--all`)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Short flags are prefaced by a single dash `-` while long flags are prefaced by a double dash `--`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between short and long flags is that short flags can be combined, so for example `-ml` would be the combination of two flags, `m` and `l`. With long flags,  everything after the `--` is parsed as a single word, rather than a combination of single-letter options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the additional inputs or parameters that the command requires to perform its intended function. Arguments can vary depending on the command being used. They can include file names, directories, data to process, or any other information needed by the command. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example the command:\n",
    "\n",
    " `ls my_dir` \n",
    "\n",
    "Will list the contents of the `my_dir` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/ls_my_dir.gif\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "     \n",
    "> You can run `command --help` or `man command` (manual) for any command, to read about how a particular command works."
