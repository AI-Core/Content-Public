    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why learn to use a CLI-based text editor? While GUI text editors (like Microsoft Word or Notepad) can be more intuitive and user-friendly, especially for beginners, CLI text editors can offer a great deal of power and flexibility for those willing to learn them, and there are several situations where you might prefer using a CLI text editor over a GUI-based one: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote Access**: When you're connecting into a remote computer, you often don't have access to a GUI and a CLI-based text editor is all you have to work with\n",
    "- **Automation**: CLI text editors can be easily incorporated into scripts and automated tasks\n",
    "- **Speed:** If you're good with a CLI text editor, it can be much faster to make edits with keyboard commands than using a mouse in a GUI editor\n",
    "- **Saving Resources:** CLI text editors generally consume less computer power compared to GUI editors\n",
    "- **Compatibility:** CLI text editors are standard tools available by default on almost all systems, allowing you to work on different systems without having to learn new software\n",
    "- **Stability:** CLI text editors are incredibly stable and less prone to crashes compared to many GUI applications"

    "## Writing Text to a File \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic form of editing that you might want to do in the CLI is to write some text directly to a file from the CLI. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Unix systems, this is accomplished with the `echo` command, and the `>` operator. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo Hello, world! > hello.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/echo_cat.gif\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `>` operator will overwrite whatever is currently in the file if the filename you specify already exists, and create a new file if it does not already exist. To append text to a file that already exists, use the `>>` operator instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Windows Powershell equivalent of `echo` is called `Write-Output`, but you can also use the same syntax as Unix systems, thanks to default aliases. "

    "## Command Line Text Editors\n",
    "\n",

CLI text editors are programs that can be controlled entirely in the terminal, using just the keyboard. Despite their simple interface, they can be very sophisticated and powerful. \n",

    "\n",
    "> Nano is a popular text editor native to Unix-like operating systems, though it can also be installed on Windows. It's known for its simplicity and ease of use, especially for beginners. Nano operates in a straightforward way that's similar to notepad or other simple GUI text editors, and it doesn't require learning complex commands or modes. It provides basic text editing capabilities and displays key shortcuts at the bottom of the screen, making it an excellent choice for quick edits in the command line environment.\n",

    "### Installing Nano\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "Nano is installed by default on Mac, so typically no installation is required. However, if you need to reinstall it for some reason, the easiest way is via `homebrew` (aka `brew`), a command-line package manager. Package managers are programs that provide easy installation for programs or features you need to add to your command line environment. We will talk more about them later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install nano using `brew`, we first need to install brew as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once the installation is complete, you can install nano as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`brew install nano`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux systems may vary as to whether nano is installed by default, but you can check if you have it, using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`which nano`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have nano installed, you can install it using `apt`, which is the default package manager for Linux. First update `apt` using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt update`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then install nano with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt install nano`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows does not have nano installed by default, but it comes with GitBash, so once you have installed this you can use nano from your bash terminal."

    "For example, Vim offers advanced features like different modes for efficient editing and navigation, command composition for complex edits, rapid navigation within files, customization options, extensibility through scripting and plugins, and the ability to work with split windows and tabs. It also integrates with the command line shell, allowing you to run shell commands without leaving the editor.\n",
