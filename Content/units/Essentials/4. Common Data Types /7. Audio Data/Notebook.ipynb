    "# Audio Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio is a little more complicated than other data types like images; sound is an analog signal, which is made up of waves travelling through matter. The computer needs to convert this signal into a digital format to be machine readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sound card on your computer performs this process for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sounds card has __four__ main processing components to perform this task.\n",
    "  - __analog-to-digital converter (ADC)__ - to process the incoming analog signal into a digital format, e.g. sound recorded by your microphone. \n",
    "  - __digital-to-analog converter (DAC)__ - converts the digital audio signal on your pc to an analog format so you can listen to it, e.g. converted to analog and output through the speakers. \n",
    "  - __PCI interface__ - to connect the sound card to the motherboard.\n",
    "  - __Input and output__ - for devices such as a microphone or speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound cards represent audio with the following process:\n",
    "- When an incoming audio is detected by the sound card it will take measurements (samples) of it at regular intervals.\n",
    "  - __Sampling rate__ is defined as the number of samples taken per second of the sound card.\n",
    "  - Sampling rate is measured in hertz (one hertz is one sample per second).\n",
    "  - The higher the hertz, the better quality of  the sound representation.\n",
    "- __Sampling resolution__ is the numbers of bits used to represent the audio.\n",
    "  - The higher the resolution, the better the representation of the sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "True sound (yellow), then visualisations of low and higher sampling rate:\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "Commonly, audio data is visualised as a spectrogram. A spectrogram shows time on the horizontal axis, and frequency on the vertical axis with brighter colors where that frequency is present.\n",
