    "Computers don't see images the way we see them, when an image is stored on your computer it needs to be stored in a way in which the computer can understand. \n",
    "- They see images as a 2D matrix or 3D array where the third dimension represents the channels.\n",
    "- Each unit in that grid is a __pixel__.\n",
    "- Your resolution determines the size of this matrix. A resolution of 800 x 600 would be a grid of size 800 by 600 pixels.\n",
    "- Each pixel has a number associated with it determining its colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this is how a computer would represent a grayscale image:\n",
    "- __Grayscale__ images have one channel to represent the image(gray).\n",
    "- Colours on computers are usually represented using 8-bit numbers giving a set of 8 zeros and ones. This gives 2<sup>8</sup> or 256 possible representations of each pixel.\n",
    "- Each representation describes the intensity or brightness of that particular colour. In this case, 0 is black and 255 would represent white."

    "- __RGB__ is represented by three channels - __Red__, __Green__ and __Blue__.\n",
    "- The channels are combined together to create the image.\n",
    "- All red would be expressed as (255, 0, 0), green by (0, 255, 0) and blue by (0, 0, 255).\n",
    "- White can be  by (255, 255, 255) and black by (0, 0, 0).\n",
    "- Any other colour can be represented by a combination of all three. For instance (106, 13, 173) would represent the colour purple. \n",

    "  - __M__ for Mageneta \n",
    "  - __Y__ or Yellow \n",
    "  - __K__ for Black \n",
    "- Another common one is Hexadecimal format.\n",
    "  - Each colour is represented by # followed by six characters #RRGGBB.\n",
    "  - Each RR (red), GG (green), and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF. \n",
    "  - For example, #0000FF displays blue since FF is the highest representation and 00 is the lowest.\n",
    "  - #CC5500 would represent a burnt orange colour can you see why?\n"
