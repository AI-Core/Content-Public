    1. Create two dictionaries as follows: dict_1 = {'London': [51.509865,-0.118092]} and dict2 = {'Paris': [48.864716, 2.349014]}
    2. Put them into a list as follows: my_list = [dict_1, dict_2]
    3. You now have a list, where each element is a dictionary containing a city name and a lat/long co-ordinate pair.
    4. Write a script that loops through the list and prints out the lattitude of each city like this: "Paris: 48.864716"

    1. Create a list of 3 dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the keys "name", "age" and "favourite_colour". 
    2. Assign appropriate values to each key in each dictionary.
    3. Use nested for loops to iterate through each dictionary, and assign all the key-value pairs to a single dictionary.
