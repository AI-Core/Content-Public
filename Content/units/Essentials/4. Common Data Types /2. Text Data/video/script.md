<!-- TEXT DATA IS JUST ANY FORM OF WRITING SAVED IN A FILE -->
<!-- THERE'S SO MUCH IMAGE DATA OUT THERE -->
<!-- CAN COME IN MANY DIFFERENT FILE TYPES -->
<!-- THE RAW CHARACTERS CAN BE SAVED IN THE FILE, SO IT OFTEN DOESN'T NEED TO BE FORMATTED OR ENCODED IN ANY FANCY WAY -->
<!-- BECAUSE OF THAT WHEN YOU READ THEM IN USING CODE YOU CAN USUALLY JUST ACCESS THE TEXT DATA WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL DECODING -->
<!-- SHOW TXT FILE -->
<!-- BUT SOME FILES CONTAIN MORE THAN JUST TEXT -->
<!-- FOR EXAMPLE, IF A PDF FILE HAS A FANCY BACKGROUND, THEN THAT INFORMATION MUST ALSO BE STORED IN THE FILE -->
<!-- USUALLY WHEN WE OPEN THEM, OUR COMPUTER LOOKS AT THE FILE EXTENSION AND USES THE RIGHT PROGRAM TO HELP US TO VIEW IT, RATHER THAN SHOWING US THE RAW DATA WHICH IT CONTAINS -->
<!-- BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RAW DATA, YOU CAN SEE IT CONTAINS MORE THINGS LIKE FORMATTING -->
<!-- SO IN THAT CASE YOU MIGHT NEED TO FIND HOW IT'S FORMATTED TO GET TO THE TEXT YOU WANT -->
