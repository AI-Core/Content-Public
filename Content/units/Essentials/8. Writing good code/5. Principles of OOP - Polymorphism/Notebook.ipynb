    "Many languages implement composition through interfaces, which are formal definitions of methods and data that a particular class MUST implement. Python does not have interfaces, but by using multiple inheritance, we can build a similar mechanism, which in Python is referred to as a mixin.\n",
    "\n",
    " A mixin is a class that provides methods to other classes but are not considered a base class. For example, a dog can speak and roll_over, and eventually you will want to create a class that can speak and roll_over, so you can create classes to be inherited to add the speak and rolling over abilities for other objects."
