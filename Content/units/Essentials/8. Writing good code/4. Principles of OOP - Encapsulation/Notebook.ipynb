    "Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that promotes the idea of bundling data and behaviors related to a particular entity into a single unit known as a class. It allows us to hide the internal implementation details of an object and expose only those methods and properties that are necessary for its intended usage. This is achieved by providing access control mechanisms to protect the data from unwanted modifications and ensure that the object's state remains consistent."

    "##  Key Features of Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data and Behavior Together**: In OOP, encapsulation emphasizes keeping the data and the operations that act on that data within the same class. This bundling of data and behavior into a single unit provides a clear boundary for the functionality related to the object, making it easier to understand and maintain the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Access Control**: Encapsulation allows us to define access levels for different members of the class, such as *public*, *private*, and *protected*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Public members can be accessed from outside the class, while private members are hidden and can only be accessed from within the class itself. This access control ensures that the internal implementation details are not exposed directly to the outside world, preventing unintended misuse of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Information Hiding**: By using encapsulation, we can enforce information hiding, which means that the internal details of an object are hidden from the outside world. This promotes better code organization, reduces dependencies, and makes it easier to change the internal implementation without affecting the external code that uses the class."

    "##  Benefits of Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- ** Modularity**: Encapsulation supports modularity in programming by breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts. Each class represents a specific module with a well-defined interface, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security and Integrity**: By restricting direct access to the internal data of a class, encapsulation ensures that the object's state remains consistent and prevents unauthorized modification. It enhances the security and integrity of the data within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Encapsulation encourages reusability since classes can be used as building blocks in different parts of the program. By defining a clear interface for a class, other developers can use it without needing to understand its internal implementation."

    "## Abstraction vs Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction and encapsulation are both important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes and apply to different aspects of code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by presenting only the essential features to the outside world, while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows us to create a high-level view of an object or a system, focusing on what it does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is all about defining interfaces and functionality without getting into the internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the `AnimalScraper` class below. This class is an example of abstraction, as it encapsulates a set of methods that form a pipeline to scrape and process animal data from a website. The user of the `AnimalScraper` class doesn't need to know the intricate details of each method's implementation; they only need to interact with the high-level functionality provided by the class."
