    "Here is the solution: instead of creating a rigid inheritance structure, we can leverage Python's duck typing and multiple inheritance. As we saw, Python allows multiple inheritance, and it is possible to create a class that inherits from multiple classes.\n",

    "Following this principle, composition is a more flexible alternative to inheritance. It is possible to create a class that contains characteristics from many parent classes, so we can use that feature to ONLY inherit what we want.\n",

    "Many languages implement composition through interfaces, which are formal definitions of methods and data that a particular class MUST implement. Python does not have interfaces, but by using multiple inheritance, we can build a similar mechanism, which in Python is referred to as a mixin.\n",
    "\n",
    " A mixin is a class that provides methods to other classes but are not considered a base class. For example, a dog can speak and roll_over, and eventually you will want to create a class that can speak and roll_over, so you can create classes to be inherited to add the speak and rolling over abilities for other objects."
