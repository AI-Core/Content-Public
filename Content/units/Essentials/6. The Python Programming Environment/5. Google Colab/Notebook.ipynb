    "> Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, visualizations, explanatory text, and more. These documents, called *notebooks*, provide an interactive environment for coding and data analysis. Think of it as a digital notebook where you can write code, run it, and see the results instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab builds upon the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook by offering a cloud-based platform. This means you don't need to worry about installing any software or setting up complex environments on your local machine. All you need is a web browser, and you can start coding in Python right away."

    "## Benefits of Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cloud-Based Environment**: With Google Colab, your code and data reside in the cloud, which means you can access and work on your projects from anywhere with an internet connection. This also allows for easy collaboration with teammates or sharing your work with others\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Free Access to Computing Resources**: Google Colab provides you with free access to computing resources, which are essential for performing computations and running your code efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pre-installed Libraries and Dependencies**: Google Colab comes with popular Python libraries and dependencies pre-installed. This eliminates the need for manual installations, allowing you to start coding right away without worrying about compatibility issues.\n",
    "> Libraries, in the context of programming, are collections of pre-written code that solve specific problems or provide additional functionalities. They contain code that you can utilize in your own programs without having to write everything from scratch. Libraries are designed to save time, promote code reusability, and simplify complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive Execution and Visualization**: You can write code in Colab using *code cells*. These cells can be executed individually or all at once, making it easy to experiment and visualize the output in real-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration with Google Drive**: Google Colab seamlessly integrates with Google Drive, allowing you to store and access your notebooks and data files. This integration simplifies data management and makes it easy to share files with collaborators.\n"

Once you've written your code in a code cell, you can execute it by clicking the **Play** button on the left side cell or using the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Enter`. Don't worry about knowing how to write any Python code for now, you will learn how to do so in future lessons. The output of the code cell will be displayed below the cell, including any text output, plots, or errors generated by your code. \n",
