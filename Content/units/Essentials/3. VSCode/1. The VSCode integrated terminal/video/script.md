<!-- INTEGRATED TERMINAL -->

- one of the most important things that you will be using within vscode is the integrated terminal
- this is a terminal just like your regular one, but it's fit nicely into vscode
- you can open up many terminals at once and flip between them
- or you can even have them side by side

<!-- Setting the right terminal -->

- one such thing you might want to change for example, is the default terminal, which should be bash or zsh instead of cmd or powershell, which are not commonly used in industry
