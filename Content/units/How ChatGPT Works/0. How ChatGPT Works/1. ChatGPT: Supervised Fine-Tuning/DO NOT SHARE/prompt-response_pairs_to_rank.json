They should study Ashwin and Jadeja's bowling style, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and accordingly devise a plan to tackle them.\n\nImprove footwork: Facing spin bowling requires excellent footwork, and the Australian team should focus on improving their footwork. They should practice playing the spinners with decisive footwork, both forward and back.\n\nPlay spinners with a positive mindset: The Australian batsmen should play the spinners with a positive mindset and look to score runs off their bowling rather than just surviving. They should not allow the spinners to settle into a rhythm and dictate terms.\n\nPractice against quality spin bowling: The Australian team should simulate match-like situations in their training sessions and practice against quality spin bowling. They can also use video analysis to identify areas of improvement and work on them.\n\nBe patient: Facing quality spin bowling requires patience and concentration, and the Australian team should be prepared to bat for long periods without scoring runs. They should be willing to rotate the strike and wait for the loose deliveries to score runs.\n\nUse sweep shots: The sweep shot is an effective way to counter spin bowling, and the Australian team should practice playing the sweep shot against spinners. The sweep shot can put pressure on the spinners and also score runs."

It was introduced by Google DeepMind in 2015 and has been successfully applied in various tasks such as playing Atari games and controlling robotic systems.\n\nPolicy Gradient Methods: Policy Gradient methods are a family of RL algorithms that directly optimize the policy of the agent, without computing the value function explicitly. These methods use gradient descent to update the policy parameters and have been shown to be effective in complex tasks, such as playing games with high-dimensional action spaces.\n\nActor-Critic Methods: Actor-Critic methods combine the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods by having two separate networks, one for the policy (the actor) and one for the value function (the critic). These methods have been shown to be effective in continuous control tasks, such as robotic manipulation and locomotion.\n\nModel-based Reinforcement Learning: Model-based RL algorithms learn a model of the environment and then use this model to plan actions. These algorithms can be more sample efficient than model-free algorithms, but are often harder to scale to large, complex environments.\n\nModel-free off-policy RL: Recent work has focused on combining the sample efficiency of model-based RL with the scalability of model-free methods. These methods use off-policy learning to learn from past experiences, and can be more sample efficient than purely model-free methods."
