    "# How ChatGPT Works Part 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a popular technique used to train a language model by fine-tuning a pre-trained large language model on a specific task or domain. In SFT, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned by providing it with labeled data, which enables the model to learn the nuances of the task or domain it is being trained for. SFT has been widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for various applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text classification.\n",
