    "## What is Tableau?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tableau is a powerful data visualisation tool that major companies worldwide leverage to help them visualise data, and to create real-time dynamic dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make sense of raw data, and to get a better understanding of underlying trends, correlations and relationships, organisations often rely on data visualisation tools to help them derive meaningful insights. Data visualisation is one important step of the data analytics (sometimes referred to as business intelligence) process, and is usually the layer of the data infrastructure that business executives deal with the most. Data analytics tools ingest data from one or more sources in order to present them in a user-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can  be seen in the diagram below, data visualisation is usually the final phase of the data flow in an organisation (data moves from left to right):\n",

    "<figcaption align=\"center\"><cite>Typical Organisational Data Flow</cite></figcaption font-style=\"Italic\">\n",
    " </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical data flow in a large company works as follows:\n",
    "1. Data is created (by apps, web activity, transaction systems and so on..)\n",
    "2. Data is then ingested into data pipeline tools such as Kafka\n",
    "3. Transformation operations are performed on the data using powerful tools like Spark\n",
    "4. Data is persisted in some data store (either SQL or NoSQL) which can be on-premise or in the cloud\n",
    "5. Data is then exported to a data visualisation tool, like Tableau, for reporting and dashboard creation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A large majority of data engineering projects are actually initiated in order to enable data visualisation and dashboard creation for various business departments. For example, a global retailer such as Amazon might want to see the inventory of all of its products in real-time, and to be able to filter through the various categories, countries and cities with a click of a button. Tableau would be a perfect tool to use in this scenario, and extensive back-end data engineering tasks would be required in order to clean, transform, integrate and prepare the data for visualisation."

    "## Limitations of Tableau \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the numerous features and benefits that Tableau offers, there are some downsides which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High license costs\n",
    "    - Currently, the cost per individual user is around 56GBP per month and is billed annually\n",
    "- Inflexible pricing model\n",
    "    - Tableau requires an annual payment, rather than a pay-as-you-go model which many other software vendors provide\n",
    "    - Also, due to the high pricing costs, scaling of the tool across large organisations becomes difficult and expensive. \n",
    "- There have been some complaints regarding after-sales support and help desk communication\n",
    "- The tool doesn't provide a solid version control system\n",
    "- Some security concerns have been raised, especially for the locally installed versions of Tableau (such as Public and Desktop)\n",
    "- Data refresh needs to be manual, since Tableau currently doesn't support refreshing data automatically using schedulers\n",
    "- No support for importing visual diagram and dashboards from other tools"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data analytics in large multinational companies is closely intertwined with and depends on data engineering activities. Data engineering tasks help to prepare the data for visualisation in executive dashboards\n",
    "- Data visualisation activities help organisations to better understanding hidden patterns, trends and correlations in their data in order to derive useful insights and to perform better data-driven decision-making\n",
    "- Tableau is a powerful data visualisation tool that has several products including Prep, Desktop, Server, Online, mobile and Public\n",
    "- Tableau's main features include: ability to quickly create code-free dashboards, ability to connect to a variety of data sources, a wide range of readily available dashboard styles, a flexible way to create data filters, ability to integrate scripting languages such as SQL to perform complex queries, mobile-friendly customisations, the availability of a large and active support community online, and the ease of performing software upgrades  \n",
    "- On the other hand, Tableau's main limitations are: it's high cost and inflexible pricing model, poor after-sales support, lack of a version control system, some security concerns especially with the locally installed versions of the tool, lack of automatic data refresh capabilities and the lack of support for importing dashboards from other tools"
