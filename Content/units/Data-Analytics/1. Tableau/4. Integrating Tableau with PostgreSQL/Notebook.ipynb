    "## Connect to PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since our data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, we'll need to use the `PostgreSQL connector` to integrate Tableau with PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 approaches to connecting Tableau with PostgreSQL depending on where you set up the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Connect a locally installed Tableau Desktop to a locally installed PostgreSQL database\n",
    "- 2. Connect a locally installed Tableau Desktop to an AWS-hosted PostgreSQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches will be discussed, but we will focus more on the 2nd approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Before connecting Tableau to PostgreSQL RDS, ensure that you have properly set up your cloud environment, in addition to PostgreSQL and all required data/tables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Open the Connectors menu\n",
    "\n",
    "From Tableau's main homepage, look for the `To a Server` section and click on the `More` button. This will open a large list of available connectors as shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Click on the PostgreSQL Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the PostgreSQL connector. A new window should appear asking for certain settings to be entered. This is how the window looks:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. Enter Required Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to establish the connection, we need to provide the following details under the `General` tab:\n",
    "- Server\n",
    "    - Enter `localhost` if you've installed the database on your local machine or\n",
    "    - Enter the AWS RDS endpoint if you're using a cloud-hosted version of PostgreSQL\n",
    "        - The endpoint URL should look something like `flightsdatabase.cn4l7x18cmks.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`\n",
    "- Port\n",
    "    - Enter `5432`\n",
    "    - This is the port that PostgreSQL always uses by default\n",
    "- Database\n",
    "    - Add the database name you created earlier\n",
    "- Authentication\n",
    "    - Leave it as `Username and Password`\n",
    "- Username\n",
    "    - Enter your PostgreSQL username\n",
    "    - This is the username you created when setting up your database\n",
    "    - If you followed the previous instructions in the SQL notebook, it should be `postgres`\n",
    "- Password\n",
    "    - Enter your PostgreSQL password\n",
    "    - This should be the password you set up while creating your database\n",
    "- Require SSL\n",
    "    - Leave this unchecked (empty box)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your settings should look something like this:\n",

    "<img src= \"images/tableau-postgresql-connector-filled.png\" width=400>\n",
    "<figcaption align=\"center\"><cite>Tableau PostgreSQL Connector - Local machine</cite></figcaption>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Leave the second tab `Initial SQL` as it is and don't change anything there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Initiate the Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that all settings are ready, click on the `Sign in` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything goes smoothly, Tableau should display a message saying it's connecting to the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection completes successfully, Tableau will open a new window which displays the data it connected to. The window will look something like this:\n",

    "<img src= \"images/tableau-homepage2.png\" width=600>\n",
    "<figcaption align=\"center\"><cite>Tableau Main Data Screen</cite></figcaption>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming all goes well, you now have Tableau and PostgreSQL integrated, and you can access the database from within Tableau. This allows you to start analysing the data and to create advanced visualisations, as we'll see in upcoming notebooks."
