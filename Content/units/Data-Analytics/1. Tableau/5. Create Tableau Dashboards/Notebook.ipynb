    "## Overview of Tableau's User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "When first launching Tableau Desktop, and after successfully connecting to the back-end database, this is the main interface that you'll see:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tableau-p1.png\" width=900>\n",
    "<figcaption align=\"center\"><cite>Tableau's Main Data Homepage Overview</cite></figcaption>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly explain the main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Main Menu\n",
    "\n",
    "This item contains Tableau's main menu which allows users to do a variety of tasks such as:\n",
    "- Creating new workbooks\n",
    "- Saving current work\n",
    "- Connecting to new data sources\n",
    "- Changing server settings\n",
    "- Getting help\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Source Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "- This item displays the currently connected data sources (it's possible to connect multiple data sources simultaneously)\n",
    "- It shows the data source type (PostgreSQL), the database name, and all connected tables (Flights etc.)\n",
    "- It also allows users to create some SQL queries that are implemented on the fly across the connected tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Connection Type\n",
    "\n",
    "- This item shows the type of current connection (Live or Extract), and allows users to toggle between them\n",
    "- A _Live_ connection means that the data visible in Tableau is updated as the back-end database tables are updated (in real-time)\n",
    "- An _Extract_ takes a copy of the data and does not update in real-time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "- This item provides users with the option of applying any specific filters on incoming data\n",
    "- For instance, we can determine that we only want the data for a specific Year (e.g. 1996) to be ingested into the dashboard, and all other years should be excluded\n",
    "- By using this approach, we minimise the amount of data ingested to speed up the dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Table and Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "- This section shows the currently connected tables, the row count and the total number of fields (columns)\n",
    "- It also displays the name of each field and the table it is coming from\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Datas Sources and Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar to how Microsoft Excel uses tabs, Tableau also leverages this approach to create new dashboards\n",
    "- It allows users to connect to new data sources and to create a new worksheet, dashboard or story\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6.1 Data Source Tab\n",
    "- This is used to connect to a wide variety of data sources such as SQL databases, NoSQL data stores and files\n",
    "- You can connect more than one data source simultaneously to create encriched dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6.2 New Worksheet\n",
    "- Allows creating several different types of reports such as heat maps, bar charts and so on\n",
    "- This interface allows users to build different _views_ of their data\n",
    "- You can drag and drop the various fields into _columns_ and _rows_\n",
    "- Users can also add filters and other criteria\n",
    "- Worksheets are the main building blocks for data visualisations\n",
    "- For example, a sheet could be the Flights data for the year 1987 \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6.3 New Dashboard\n",
    "- A dashboard is a combination of several views (sheets)\n",
    "- It is more complex than a simple sheet\n",
    "- The views can be arranged in a presentation-like manner\n",
    "- For example, a dashboard can combine the Flights data for 5 years (1987 to 1991) and allows users to drill-down on the details of each year\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6.4 New Story\n",
    "- A story combines multiple sheets and/or dashboards together \n",
    "- Allows users to interact with the story and to click various parts of it to drill down on the data to get more details\n",
    "- For example, a story could be focusing on: Which airports have the most delays, and users can click on various parts of the story to get information about each airport\n",
    "\n",

    "## Tableau Worksheets View\n",
    "\n",
    "A new Tableau worksheet can be created by clicking on the `New Worksheet` tab at the bottom left of the main Tableau homepage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sheets are the main building blocks in Tableau - they allow users to manipulate data, perform a variety of reports by organising the data into different columns and rows, and provide a wide variety of chart types to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the sheets view looks. The main parts are highlighted and are explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tableau-p22.png\" width=900>\n",
    "<figcaption align=\"center\"><cite>Tableau Worksheet Overview</cite></figcaption>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Main Menu and Toolbar\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the main menu which contains all available options to the user\n",
    "- Notice how the main menu in the sheets view has different options than the main menu in the Tableau homepage view we saw earlier\n",
    "- Below the main menu is a toolbar which contains the main options users tend to frequently access (such as Save, Undo, connect a new data source etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Side bar - Data and Analytics Panes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This sidebar contains a list of connected tables and fields available in those tables\n",
    "- It also contains the Analytics and Data panes\n",
    "- It is an expandable and collapsable area that can be customised\n",
    "- The various fields can be dragged and dropped into the _Columns_ and _Rows_ section (#4 in the image above) to create desired visualisations \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1 Data Pane\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shows all available data sources in a given workbook\n",
    "- For each data source, it displays the available tables and fields\n",
    "- Users build visualisations by adding available fields from the Data Pane to the View they are working on\n",
    "- There are 2 types of fields:\n",
    "    - __Dimension Fields__:\n",
    "        - This type of field represents _qualitative_ values\n",
    "        - Examples include customer names and order dates\n",
    "    - __Measure Fields__:\n",
    "        - This type of field represents _quantitative_ (numeric) values\n",
    "        - Users can apply aggregations to these types of fields\n",
    "        - Examples include salary information, product sales etc.\n",
    "    - __Calculated Fields__:\n",
    "        - Tableau also allows users to create their own derived fields and to save them as part of the data source\n",
    "        - Calculated fields can be used if the available data doesn't include all the required data needed to prepare the visualisations\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2 Analytics Pane\n",
    "\n",
    "- This pane provides users with the option of adding analytics objects to their visualisation\n",
    "- _Analytics objects_ are pre-built calculations that can be directly applied to a view by dragging and dropping it\n",
    "- For example, an _Average Line_ will automatically calculate the average of all the numbers in the view and draw a line accordingly\n",
    "- There are 3 types of analytics available:\n",
    "    - __Summary__:\n",
    "        - Contains various summary details such as calculating the Total or the Average\n",
    "    - __Model__:\n",
    "        - Applies specific models on the data, such as a Trend Line\n",
    "    - __Custom__:\n",
    "        - Create more advanced and customised statistics, such as a Distribution Band\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pages, Filters and Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "- This section provides various _cards_, which is a Tableau pre-built section that provides certain features which can be applied to the various fields\n",
    "- By dragging and dropping fields into cards, it helps users to quickly build visualisations\n",
    "- 3 of the popular types of cards include:\n",
    "    - __Pages__:\n",
    "        - This shelf is an advanced feature that allows users to break down a specific view into multiple sub-pages to allow for better data analysis\n",
    "        - The Pages shelf automatically creates a group of pages, each having a different view\n",
    "        - For example, you can create a view that shows the profit for a specific product broken down by region for each day of the month\n",
    "        - [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywGiue8WUjs) for an overview on how to use pages\n",
    "    - __Filters__:\n",
    "        - This shelf allows filtering of fields by a wide variety of criteria\n",
    "        - It allows users to determine which data to include in the visualisation and which data to exclude\n",
    "        - Numeric fields can be filtered by range, at-least value, at-most value, and null or not null values\n",
    "        - For example, we can include Flights data that have only a specific Origin or Destination\n",
    "    - __Marks__:\n",
    "        - This card is one of essential options for visualisations\n",
    "        - Field properties and colors can be assigned within the Marks card\n",
    "        - The Type and Size of certain elements on visualisations can be modified as well  \n",
    "        - Labels and Tooltips can also be added to visualisations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Columns and Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "- This section is one of the main parts of the visualisation\n",
    "- We can drag and drop the various fields we want to analyse into columns or rows\n",
    "- We can add raw fields or aggregated fields (such as SUM)\n",
    "- For example, to visualize the flight Departure Delay by Carrier, we'd put the Carrier in the Rows and the SUM(Departure Delays) in the Columns section\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Charts and Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "- This section displays all possible charts, graphs and other visualisations that Tableau provides\n",
    "- Based on the data fields you assigned to columns and rows, Tableau will automatically highlight the charts that are valid will grey out the ones that are invalid or not appropriate\n",
    "- Popular types of visualisations include:\n",
    "    - Pie charts\n",
    "    - Bar charts\n",
    "    - Treemaps\n",
    "    - Area charts\n",
    "    - Line charts\n",
    "- Depending on the data types being analysed, certain charts make more sense to be used to visualise the data\n",
    "- For more information on which type of chart is best for your data needs, check out the [official documentation](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/what_chart_example.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Data Sources and Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the same section that we had in the Tableau homepage\n",
    "- It remains  consistently available throughout all views and visualisation tabs while using Tableau\n",
    "- Refer to the previous section for details\n",
