    "# DAX and Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "> *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)* is a powerful formula language used in Power BI's **Report View** and **Report View** to derive new features and insights from the existing data in your model. It employs a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be combined to build formulas for defining measures, calculated columns and calculated tables.\n",

    "## DAX Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A DAX expression starts with an equal sign `=` and is followed by functions, operators, constants, or references to other elements. Here's a simple breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equal Sign (`=`):** Every DAX formula begins with an equal sign.\n",
    "- **Function:** Most DAX expressions are composed of one or more of the array of 200+ functions in the DAX library, for example `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, or `COUNT()`\n",
    "- **Operators:** DAX uses operators to perform arithmetic, comparison, and text operations\n",
    "- **Constants:** DAX expressions can also contain static values, e.g. numbers like `5` or text strings enclosed in double quotes like `\"Product\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referencing in DAX\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tables:** Just use the table name to reference a table, for example: `Orders`\n",
    "- **Columns:** Reference a column by enclosing the table name and column name in square brackets. For instance: `[Order Date]` or `Orders[Order Date]`\n",
    "- **Measures:** When referencing measures, use the measure name directly or with the table name, e.g. `[Total Sales]` or `Orders[Total Sales]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "DAX includes a variety of operators, some of the most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`\n",
    "- **Comparison Operators:** `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>` (not equal to)\n",
    "- **Text Concatenation:** Use the `&` operator to combine two text strings\n",
    "- **Logical Operators:** `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `NOT`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nesting Functions:** DAX expressions can be nested, meaning you can use the result of one function as the argument of another, e.g. `SUMX(FILTER(Orders, Orders[Unit Price] > 100), Orders[Number of Items])`.\n",
    "2. **Context Awareness:** Always remember that DAX formulas are context-aware. They'll change their result based on the filter and row context.\n",
    "3. **Comments:** In DAX, you can include comments in your code using `//` for single-line comments or `/* */` for multi-line comments. This is useful for documentation and understanding complex formulas later.\n"

    "## Measures in DAX\n",
    "\n",
    "In Power BI, a *Measure* is a calculation that’s performed on data in the data model. The calculation is the result of evaluating a DAX expression, and to be a measure, this must evaluate to a single value, as opposed to a calculated column, which will evaluate to a single value per row in the source table. Measures are used to calculate results \"on the fly\" as the user explores and interacts with visuals on Power BI reports. This means that a measure will obey the filter context in which it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, let's look at a simple example. Say we have an order table, whose head 5 rows look like this:\n",

    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  Order Count = COUNT(Orders[Order ID])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **COUNTDISTINCT** Enumerates the number of distinct values in a column, for example to return the number of different customer IDs in an orders table:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```DAX\n",
    "  Order Count = COUNTDISTINCT(Orders[Customer ID] )\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "### Extended Aggregation Functions: The “X” Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, while functions like `SUM` and `COUNT` operate directly on columns, their \"X\" counterparts, like `SUMX` and `COUNTX`, offer more versatility. They allow you to iterate over a table or a table expression and then perform aggregations.\n",

    "\n",
    "You want to create a measure to calculate the total revenue after applying the discounts to each product. Instead of creating a separate calculated column for the discounted price and then summing that column, you can use `SUMX` to iterate over the `Sales` table, calculate the discounted price for each product, and then sum these values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DAX formula would look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Differences Between Standard and Extended Forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct vs. Iterative:** Standard aggregation functions like `SUM` and `AVERAGE` work directly on entire columns, but their extended counterparts iterate through rows, performing calculations based on expressions\n",
    "2. **Flexibility:** \"X\" functions like `SUMX` or `COUNTX` offer more complex aggregations, enabling custom operations on each row of a table before the aggregation\n",
    "3. **Performance Consideration:** Iterative functions, by nature, might be slower, especially with large datasets, because they evaluate the expression row-by-row\n"

    "Filter context is the environment in which a DAX formula is evaluated. When you introduce a measure to a report, its values adjust based on the context. For example, if you plot a measure like `Total Revenue` on a bar chart segmented by product category, the product category is an implicit or automatic filter context, which causes the measure to evaluate differently on each bar. However, you might add an additional filter to restrict the filter context of the entire visual to a specific year, so that only that year's data are displayed on the chart.\n",

So for example, in a bar chart broken down by product category, it would apply the product category filter, but would only show values for the East region.

    "### `USERELATIONSHIP`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `USERELATIONSHIP` function is used in `CALCULATE` to specify a relationship to be used in a calculation. An example of where this is useful is in situations where you have multiple date fields in a table (eg. `[Order Date]` and `[Ship Date]`), connected to a single date table. Power BI can only have one active relationship between tables at a time, so if you have multiple relationships between the same pair of tables, one will be active by default, and the others will be inactive, but you can use the others in a measure with the `USERELATIONSHIP` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the table schema below is an example of a situation where there are two relationships between a pair of tables. The relationship between  `Orders[Order Date]`  and `Date[Date]` is active by default. The filter context will only be able to flow through the active relationship, which means that if we attempt to perform time intelligence calculations on `Orders[Ship Date]`, it won't work.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a sales database that tracks the sales of different products across various regions. You want to calculate the market share of a specific product in a particular region, for use in a stacked bar chart showing market share of the different products, filtered to the sales region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/market_share.png\" width=\"600\"> <br> <br>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Market Share** is typically calculated as:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Market Share} = \\frac{\\text{Sales of the Product in the Region}}{\\text{Total Sales in the Region}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's represent the sales of a particular product with a general total sales measure as follows:\n",
    "```dax\n",
    "Product Sales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This gives us a measure that will tell us the total sales of a given product in a given region, once we apply product and region filters. In other words it will adhere to the filter context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to get the denominator of the market share formula, we need to remove the product-level filter to consider all products but retain the region filter. This is where the `ALL` function comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use `ALL` like this:\n",
    "```dax\n",
    "Total Sales = CALCULATE(\n",
    "                        SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),\n",
    "                        ALL(Sales[Product])   // Remove filter from Product column but keep the region context\n",
    "                    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With these two measures, the market share for a product in a region can be computed as:\n",
    "```dax\n",
    "Market Share = DIVIDE(ProductSales, TotalSales)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the `ALL` function is crucial to remove the product filter to consider sales of all products in the region while calculating the market share.\n"

    "## The `RELATED` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RELATED` function in DAX retrieves a value from a related table using an existing relationship. It is commonly used in scenarios where data from two tables needs to be combined based on a shared key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a company that has a table of sales transactions (`Sales`) and a separate table containing employee details (`Employees`). The goal is to calculate the commission for each sale based on the employee's commission rate.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "2. **Employees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/employees_table.png\" width=\"600\"> <br> <br>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a relationship between the `Sales` table and the `Employees` table using the `EmployeeID` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create a new calculated column in the `Sales` table that shows the commission earned for each transaction. To do this we can use the following DAX formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```dax\n",
    "Commission = Sales[SaleAmount] * RELATED(Employees[CommissionRate])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the result will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/commissionrate.png\" width=\"600\"> <br> <br>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, while a relationship is present between `Sales` and `Employees`, the `RELATED` function is essential to perform calculations using data from both tables. The function fetches the commission rate for each employee and multiplies it with the sale amount to compute the commission.\n"
