    "\n",
    "In Power BI, filters can be applied to different levels of your report. We have already seen in a previous lesson how to add filters directly to visuals, but sometimes it is more appropriate to apply the filter directly to the entire report, or to a specific page of the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Report-Level Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "> Filters at the report level affect every visualisation in the entire report. They are useful for restricting the report to a specific subset of your dataset with minimal effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose your Power BI report contains sales data for the last 5 years. In the current month, management asks you to create a report for a quick high-level review of only the most recent year's sales to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than editing all your visualizations to just show the past year, you can leverage a report-level filter to quickly filter the entire report to only show sales dates from this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because report filters apply globally, adding this filter on the **Date** field to only show dates from the past year will automatically cascade to every visualization. Now the full report will only display sales from the past year without you having to edit every chart and graph individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Report-level filters can be either **Basic** (ie. specific fields) or **Advanced** (e.g. Boolean rules such as `<` `=` or `is not blank`). You cannot use **TopN** filtering, because **TopN** is too dependent on the local context to be of use.\n",

    "### Page-Level Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "> Filters at the page level apply only to the visuals on the specific page to which they are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you work for a company that manufactures and sells products worldwide. Your Power BI report contains sales data broken down by country, product, date, and other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Management asks you to create different report views for each sales region - Americas, Europe, and Asia. Rather than duplicate the entire report, you can add a page-level filter to filter the sales data separately for each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop the report page to your satisfaction, and add a report-level filter on `[Region]` set to `Americas`\n",
    "- Duplicate that report page and set the filter to `Europe`\n",
    "- Duplicate again for `Asia`\n",

    "> *Slicers* are interactive elements that allow report users to quickly filter and analyze subsets of your data. Whereas filters at the Report, Page or Visual level in Power BI are passive, and invisible to report consumers, slicers can be directly manipulated by your users to showcase different views of the data. In a sales report, for example, users could click on product categories in a slicer to only see data for those categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicers have the following features:\n",

    "\n",
    "Slicers in Power BI offer a variety of formatting options to ensure they fit seamlessly into your report's design and provide an intuitive user experience. Here are some of the primary slicer styles and their features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List**: This is the default style for slicers. It displays items in a simple list format. Users can select one or multiple items from the list to apply filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/slicer_list1.png\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dropdown**: This style collapses the slicer into a dropdown menu. It's useful when you have limited space on your report or when you have a long list of items to filter by.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/slicer_dropdown1.png\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Between**: Ideal for numeric or date fields, this slicer style allows users to specify a range by entering minimum and maximum values. For example, users can filter data between two dates or between two sales values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/between1.png\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tile**: Displays items as tiles, which can be beneficial for a more visual representation. This style is particularly effective when you have images associated with your slicer items, like product images for a product category slicer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/slicer_tile1.png\"  width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Slicer Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection Controls**: These controls dictate how users can interact with the slicer in terms of making selections. Here are the primary options:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Single Select**: This mode allows users to select only one item at a time. If a user clicks on another item, the previous selection is automatically deselected. This is useful when you want to ensure that only one filter value is applied at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Multi-Select with Checkboxes**: In this mode, checkboxes appear next to each slicer item. Users can select multiple items by checking their respective checkboxes. This is particularly beneficial when users might want to view aggregated data for several items simultaneously, like comparing sales data for multiple products.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Select All**: This option provides a **Select All** checkbox at the top of the slicer. When checked, all items in the slicer are selected, effectively removing the filter for that particular field. It's a quick way for users to revert to viewing the entire dataset after making specific selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicer Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, slicers on report pages affect all the other visualizations on that page, including each other. However you can modify them to affect only a subset of visuals on a page, or multiple pages.\n",
    "\n",

By default, when you select a data point in one visual, it affects other visuals on the same report page, and this behaviour can be modified via the **Edit Interactions** view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying Visual Interactions in Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify any visual's interactions:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Go to the **Format** section in the **Visualizations** pane\n",
    "3. Click on **Edit interactions**\n",

    "Cross-filtering is a feature where selecting a data point in one visual filters the data in another visual. For instance, if you have a bar chart showing sales by product category and a table listing individual sales, clicking on a specific category in the bar chart would filter the table to show only sales from that category. Cross filtering is the default behaviour for any pair of visuals. If you don't want it enabled, you will need to actively select an alternative.\n",

    "- **Complexity**: The more visuals you have interacting with each other, the more calculations Power BI needs to perform. Be mindful of the number of interactions you set up.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data Volume**: Large datasets can slow down interactions. Consider summarizing data or using aggregations to improve performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Visual Types**: Some visuals, like maps or scatter plots, can be more resource-intensive than simple bar or line charts. If you notice lag, consider if a different visual type can convey the same information more efficiently.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Configuring Drill-down Hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "Drill-down is all about navigating through layers of your data within a single visual. For instance, you might have a line graph of sales over time. By using a date hierarchy for the x-axis data, you can change the resolution of the chart from Year > Quarter > Month > Day etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up drill-down with a date hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the line graph you want to configure\n",
    "2. In the **Fields** pane, you'll see an area labeled **Axis**. Drag the date field you want to use to this area.\n",
    "3. Power BI automatically recognizes date fields and can create a default hierarchy for you, typically Year > Quarter > Month > Day. If not, you can manually create this hierarchy by right-clicking on the date field and selecting **New Hierarchy**.\n",
    "4. Once your hierarchy is set, you'll notice an arrow icon in the top corner of your line graph. This is the drill-down button. Clicking this will activate drill-down mode.\n",
    "5. Now, when you click on a specific year in your line graph, it will drill down to show sales by quarter for that year. Click on a specific quarter, and you'll see sales by month, and so on.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Bookmarks act as a powerful tool to capture and revisit specific views and states within your report, for example the configuration of filters and slicers, or even whether a given visual is visible or hidden. They enhance the navigation experience and allow for dynamic storytelling and presentation flows. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Bookmarks to Save Views\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a bookmark:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the **View** tab in Power BI Desktop\n",
    "2. Open the **Bookmarks** pane\n",
    "3. Adjust your report to the desired state or view\n",
    "4. In the **Bookmarks** pane, select **Add**. This will capture the current report state.\n",

    "### Managing Bookmarks \n",
    "\n",
    "As your report grows and evolves, you might end up with multiple bookmarks tailored for various scenarios or audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Renaming Bookmarks**: To keep things organized, always give your bookmarks descriptive names. Simply right-click on a bookmark in the **Bookmarks** pane and choose **Rename**.\n",
    "2. **Reordering Bookmarks**: Drag and drop bookmarks in the **Bookmarks** pane to rearrange their order, ensuring the most frequently used ones are easily accessible\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bookmark Utilization Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency is Key**: When creating multiple bookmarks, maintain consistency in what you capture. If one bookmark saves slicer states, ensure others do too, unless there's a specific reason not to. This will avoid unexpected results when the bookmarks are used.\n",
    "2. **Use for Storytelling**: Bookmarks can guide your audience through a narrative. Consider creating a sequence of bookmarks that walk users through a story or analysis flow.\n",
    "3. **Test Regularly**: As you update and modify your report, regularly test your bookmarks to ensure they still function as intended and provide the correct view\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",
    "1. Design your report with the layers or visuals you want to be optionally visible\n",
    "2. Using the **Selection Pane**, hide the layers or visuals you want to be part of this interactive feature\n",
    "3. Create a bookmark capturing this state, naming it something like \"Basic View\"\n",
    "4. Reveal the hidden layers or visuals\n",
    "5. Create another bookmark capturing this state, naming it \"Extended View\"\n",
    "6. Implement buttons or interactive elements that activate these bookmarks, allowing users to choose their preferred view\n",

    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. Adjust your report to cater to the first audience group (e.g., sales managers)\n",
    "2. Create a bookmark capturing this tailored view, naming it \"Sales Manager View\"\n",
    "3. Adjust your report for another audience (e.g., product managers)\n",
    "4. Create another bookmark capturing this view, naming it \"Product Manager View\"\n",
    "5. Add navigation elements, like buttons or dropdowns, that allow users to select their role or preference and be taken to the corresponding bookmarked view\n",

    "## Building a Navigation Bar\n",
    "\n",
    "A navigation bar enhances the user experience in multi-page Power BI reports. It provides a consistent and intuitive way for users to move between pages or jump to specific sections. Here's a step-by-step guide to building an effective navigation bar:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Buttons, Images, and Shapes\n",
    " \n",
    "Buttons, images, and shapes serve as the foundational elements of your navigation bar. They act as interactive objects that users can click on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. In a new report page, create a shape for your navigation bar, for example a rectangle running down the left-hand side of your report page. You can use a contrasting colour to make it stand out from the rest of your page\n",
    "2. To add some navigation buttons, navigate to the **Insert** tab in the ribbon and choose the **Buttons** dropdown\n",
    "2. Select a button type from various pre-designed options like **Blank**, **Arrow**, **Information** etc.\n",
    "5. Once added, resize and position the button, image, or shape on your report canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/make_navbar1.gif\" width=\"900\"> <br> <br>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can import a custom icon by choosing the **Blank** type, and then going to **Filter Pane** > **Button Style** > **Icon** and choosing the **Custom** option in the **Icon Type** dropdown. This will then reveal a field where you can browse your file system and import a custom icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linking Navigation Items to Pages and Bookmarks\n",
    " \n",
    "For the navigation bar to be functional, each element (button, image, shape) needs to be linked to a specific page or bookmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. Select the button, image, or shape you want to link\n",
    "2. In the **Format** pane, Expand the **Action** card\n",
    "3. Toggle the **Action** option to **On**\n",
    "4. From the **Type** dropdown, select either **Page navigation** or **Bookmark**\n",
    "5. If you choose **Page navigation**, select the target page from the **Destination** dropdown\n",
    "6. If you choose **Bookmark**, select the desired bookmark from the **Bookmark** dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/navigation_icon_action.gif\" width=\"900\"> <br> <br>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting and Layout for Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-organized and aesthetically pleasing navigation bar enhances user experience. Proper formatting and layout are key.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure all navigation elements (buttons, images, shapes) are of consistent size and evenly spaced. Use the alignment tools in the **Format** section for precision\n",
    "2. For buttons, customize their look by adjusting properties like **Fill**, **Outline**, and **Icons** under the **Format** section\n",
    "3. Use the **General** card in the **Format** section to precisely position elements using X and Y coordinates\n",
    "4. Consider adding a background shape or color to your navigation bar to make it distinct from the rest of the report\n",
    "5. Ensure text within buttons is clear, legible, and of consistent font and size\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Report** and  **Page-Level filters** apply filters globally to all visualizations in a report, or a single page of a report to focus on subsets of data without filtering each visual individually\n",
    "- **Slicers** add interactive slicers to explore data by filtering on field values using visible widgets \n",
    "- **Edit interactions** modifies filtering behavior between visuals using options like cross-highlighting and cross-filtering\n",
    "- Enable **Drill-down** on charts with hierarchical data to interactively navigate between broader and more granular views\n",
    "- Create contextual **Drill-through** pages that users can access by clicking points in a visual to see related data\n",
    "- **Bookmarks**: Capture snapshot views of filter, slicer, and visibility states to quickly return to customized report views\n",
    "- **Tooltips** allow you to display additional contextual details on hover for individual data points to avoid cluttering the main visualizations\n",
    "- Use interactive buttons, images, and shapes linked to pages or bookmarks to build navigation bars that connect report views\n"
