    "\n",
    "Time Intelligence functions are easier to learn if you put them into practice. To follow along with the examples in this lesson: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download this [`csv` file](https://cdn.theaicore.com/content/projects/e71908f1-fbf5-4c65-ad36-7d43589c3706/timeintelligence_sales_data.csv)\n",
    "2. Load it into a new Power Bi Desktop project (**Home** > **Get Data** > **Text/CSV**)\n",
    "3. Rename the table to `Sales`\n",
    "4. Create a new calculated column called `Sales amount`, which is `Sales[Order quantity]` * `Sales[Unit price]`\n"

    "## Configuring Date Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Date tables form the basis for most time intelligence functions in Power BI. Proper configuration ensures that your time-based calculations are both accurate and consistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of a Continuous Date Table\n",
    "\n",
    ">In many datasets, dates might appear sporadically, perhaps representing only transaction dates or specific event days. While this might seem sufficient, it can lead to misleading insights, especially when looking at periods without data. A continuous date table fills the gaps, ensuring every date within a range has a representation, even if there's no direct data for some dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if your sales data skips weekends because no transactions were made, you might get an incomplete view of a month's total days. But with a continuous date table, weekends are accounted for, and your analyses, such as average daily sales, remain accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking a Date Table in Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a complete date table, it's important to designate it correctly within Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the **Data view** in Power BI Desktop\n",
    "2. Select the date table\n",
    "3. From the **Table Tools** tab, choose **Mark as Date Table**\n",
    "4. Specify the unique date column. This will either be the date itself, or a date UUID column\n",
    "\n",
    "By marking a table as a date table, you inform Power BI of your intention to use it for time intelligence. This step ensures optimal performance during calculations and guarantees compatibility with all time intelligence functions. Always remember to define a unique date column without any missing, duplicate, or invalid dates.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Using `CALENDAR` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CALENDAR` function is a straightforward way to create a date table. It requires two parameters: a start date and an end date.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the **New Table** icon on the **Home** pane of the ribbon\n",
    "2. Enter the following DAX formula:\n",

    "Dates = CALENDAR(DATE(2020,1,1), DATE(2023,12,31))\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Creating a Custom Date Range with `DATESBETWEEN`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you might need a custom range, not strictly defined by a clear start and end. The `DATESBETWEEN` function provides this flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have a sales table and you want a date range from the first sale to a specific end date:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As you begin to design a report, it will often be necessary to add more columns to your date table to facilitate the different types of analysis you wish to perform. For example, if you wish to analyse revenue per quarter, you will want a column that gives the start date of the quarter to which each date belongs. Power BI has specific functions to help generate most of these expansions to the date table. \n",

    "### `STARTOFYEAR`, `STARTOFQUARTER`, `STARTOFMONTH`\n",
