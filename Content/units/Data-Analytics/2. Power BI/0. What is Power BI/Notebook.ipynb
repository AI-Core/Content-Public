    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is a crucial aspect of the data analytics (aka Business Intelligence) process, and is typically the layer of the data infrastructure with which non-technical business leaders interact most. Data analytics tools consume data from single or multiple sources to display the information in an approachable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Power BI* (Business Intelligence) is a powerful data visualization and analytics tool designed by Microsoft to help businesses make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. It is a suite of interactive platforms that enable users to connect to various data sources, apply transforms to raw data, and create visually appealing reports and dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power BI offers a comprehensive set of features to transform complex data into interactive visualizations, which can be easily understood by non-technical decision-makers. Users can connect to multiple data sources, including relational databases, Excel files and cloud-based services. Once connected, Power BI provides data transformation and modeling capabilities to clean, shape, and enrich data for analysis, and the resulting analytics and visualisation dashboards can be updated in real-time, to reflect changes in the connected data source."

    "## Power BI Desktop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytics and visualisation projects are typically created in Power BI Desktop, before being published to Power BI Service, although some activities, such as creating visualisations, can also be undertaken directly from the cloud service.\n",
    "The Desktop platform is built around three main views. Each view is optimised around a different stage of the analysis process, although the distinctions are not strict, and many features are available in all three views. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data View\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data View is where you can observe, explore, and manage the data loaded into your Power BI Desktop. In this view, you can transform your data: create new columns, change data types, or shape data. The data view also offers a detailed look at the tables, measures, and columns within your data model. It is similar to a traditional spreadsheet view where data is organized in a tabular format.\n",
