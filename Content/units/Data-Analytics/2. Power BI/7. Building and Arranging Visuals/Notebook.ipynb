    "Ensuring your visuals are aligned and evenly-spaced makes your report look neat and professional. Power BI has numerous helper tools to make this process simple and quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aligning Visuals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Alignment**: After selecting the visuals you want to align (use the **Ctrl** key for multiple selections), navigate to the **Format** tab in the ribbon. In the **Align** section, you'll find options such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Align Left**: Aligns the selected visuals to the leftmost edge of the leftmost visual\n",
    "   - **Align Center**: Vertically centers the selected visuals\n",
    "   - **Align Right**: Aligns the visuals to the rightmost edge of the rightmost visual\n",
    "   - **Align Top**: Aligns the visuals to the top edge of the topmost visual\n",
    "   - **Align Middle**: Horizontally centers the selected visuals\n",
    "   - **Align Bottom**: Aligns the visuals to the bottom edge of the bottommost visual\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Rulers**: Power BI's rulers can be a handy guide. By dragging the edges of one visual, you can align it to the top, bottom, or sides of another visual. As you approach the edge of another visual, Power BI will show a guiding line, helping you align them perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributing Visuals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distribute Horizontally/Vertically**: After selecting multiple visuals, you can ensure they are evenly spaced by using the **Distribute horizontally** or **Distribute vertically** options in the **Format** tab. This is especially useful when you have multiple visuals, like card visuals, that you want to space evenly across a section of your report.\n",

This can be achieved with a combination of the **Ruler** and **Distribute visuals** tools. For example if you have multiple small visuals you wish to align along the length of a larger visual, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - First, align two of the smaller to the top or bottom of the larger, using the **ruler**\n",

    "    - **Confidence Interval**: The probability that the result falls within the forecast area.

    "\n",
    "For instance, if you have a bar chart displaying revenue by product category, the product categories themselves are a result of a DAX filter that groups the data by category. This filter will be visible in the **Filter pane** under the **Filters on this visual** section. In this case, `Category` is an example of an \"implicit\" filter, in that it is used automatically in the construction of the chart.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Filtering** is the simplest form of filtering in Power BI. With this type, you can select individual items or values from a list to include or exclude from your visual. For instance, if you have a visual displaying sales across different regions, using a basic filter can help you display data for only a few selected regions, such as \"North\" and \"West.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Filtering** provides more granularity in your data representation. Instead of selecting individual items, you define rules based on conditions like \"greater than,\" \"less than,\" \"starts with,\" and so on. For example, in a visual that showcases monthly sales, employing an advanced filter can allow you to display only those months where sales exceeded $10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TopN Filtering** is tailored for scenarios where you want to spotlight the top or bottom performers. This filter type lets you set the visual to showcase the top or bottom 'N' items based on a specific measure. If, for instance, you have a visual ranking products by sales, a `TopN` filter can be configured to exhibit only the top 10 best-selling products.\n",

    "2. **Add Location Data**: Drag your geographical field (e.g., country, city, or postal code) to the **Location** section of the visual. Power BI will attempt to recognize and plot these locations on the map automatically. However if you are getting unexpected locations, you might need to help Power BI out by specifying the data category of the relevant column. For example you might have a column with two-letter geocodes such as `AL`, and without help, Power BI will not know if it means `Alabama` or `Albania`. Setting the data category to **Country** or **State or Province** will aid in this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maps can use Geographic Hierarchies to \"drill down\" into successively more granular summaries of the geographic data, but in practice it usually works best to supply a calculated column containing all of the geographic data in most cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Add Values**: Drag the measure or value you wish to represent (e.g., sales, population count) to the **Bubble Size** section. Depending on your data, the map might display bubbles, shades, or other indicators of varying sizes to represent the data magnitude for each location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customize Appearance**: In the `Format` section, adjust settings like map style, bubble colours, and zoom behaviour\n",

    "In addition to the basic Power BI map, there are also two other map types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filled Map** - Also known as a choropleth, this type of map divides the geographic area into regions. The colour of the region can be modified to display the values via conditional formatting, while additional information can be added by customising the tooltips.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ArcGiS Map** - A more advanced mapping system that allows for complex visualisations such as heatmaps and clustering\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shapes** enhance report designs and often serve as backgrounds for other visuals\n",
    "- Visual appearance and behavior are controlled using the **Format** pane\n",
    "- Power BI tools **align** tools ensure visuals align neatly and space evenly\n",
    "- **Card Visuals** display single values prominently in a report and can combine with shapes for emphasis\n",
    "- **On-Object Formatting** allows quick modifications to visual properties by direct selection\n",
    "- The **Selection Pane** facilitates grouping, renaming, and determining the stacking order of objects\n",
    "- **Gauge Visuals** offer a way to represent single values within a range, showcasing progress towards goals\n",
    "- **KPI Visuals** track metric performance against set benchmarks or targets\n",
    "- **Line Charts** display data trends over time and can enhance with trendlines and forecasting tools\n",
    "- **Table Visuals** offer a structured view of data and can enhance with conditional formatting for clearer insights\n",
    "- **Categorical Charts** visualize data comparisons across distinct categories using charts like donuts, pies, or bars\n",
    "- **Map Visuals** transform geographic data into dynamic visuals with Power BI interpreting geographical hierarchies, data types, and coordinates"
