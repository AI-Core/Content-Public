The image exhibits that the summary statistics (e.g. mean and variance) for all the data is the same.

As indicated in their abstract, this survey received 19,717 usable respondents from 171 countries and territories. Countries or territories with less than 50 respondents were classified into a group named 'Other' for anonymity. Our task with this dataset is to identify what factors significantly impact the annual salary of those in DSML."
