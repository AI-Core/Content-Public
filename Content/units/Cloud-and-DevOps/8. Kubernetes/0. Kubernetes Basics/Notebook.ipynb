    "Kubernetes has many benefits and features, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple-container Deployment**: Kubernetes enables the deployment of multiple containers across a cluster\n",
    "    - The user chooses which and how many containers should be deployed\n",
    "    - The user also specifies the number of container replicas for fault tolerance <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-healing**: If a container is down, i.e. not responding to health checks, Kubernetes will spin up a replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autoscaling**: If the current containers are not enough to process all the requirements, Kubernetes can deploy more containers within the cluster. Conversely, if the resources are in excess, Kubernetes can destroy some to maintain the required balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easily Discoverable**: Each container can be accessed by its name (or IP) and port\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load Balancing**: If a single node is overloaded by high traffic, Kubernetes distributes the load among several nodes to ensure high availability and efficient resource utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Orchestration**: Kubernetes allows us to mount storage volumes, whether they are specific to a node, shared across multiple nodes, or of another type. This capability ensures that your application can save and retrieve data reliably."

    "\n",
    "- *Nodes*: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - *Nodes* are the **worker machines** in a Kubernetes cluster. These can be physical or virtual servers.\n",
    "  - **Nodes** are responsible for running the containers that make up your applications. They provide the computing resources (CPU, memory, storage) necessary to execute these containers.\n",
    "  - Each node runs a Kubernetes runtime, such as Docker to manage and run containers <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Pods*: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Pods** are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and they are used to encapsulate one or more containers\n",
    "  - **Pods** are scheduled to run on nodes by the Kubernetes *control plane*. When you create a pod, the Kubernetes scheduler decides which node in the cluster should run that pod based on various factors like resource availability, node health, and scheduling policies.\n",
    "  - All containers within the same pod share the same network namespace, which means they can communicate with each other over `localhost` <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control Plane**: The **Control Plane** is a set of components that collectively manage and control the state of the cluster. It's responsible for making global decisions about the cluster (e.g., which nodes should run which pods), detecting and responding to cluster events, and maintaining the desired state of all resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For learning purposes, we will begin by working with a single Node on one physical machine. However, in production environments, the Control Plane spans multiple machines to increase fault tolerance, and can contain a large number Nodes, often numbering in the thousands, to meet the demands of complex applications."

    "- **Cluster State Management**: It continuously monitors and manages the cluster's desired state. This includes tracking the configuration of objects like Pods, *Services*, and *Deployments*, and ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state. We will learn in more detail about Services and Deployments later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scheduling Work**: The Control Plane is responsible for determining where and how containers should run within the cluster. It uses the *`kube-scheduler`* to make decisions about which nodes should host specific Pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scaling and Healing**: If there are discrepancies between the desired and actual states, the Control Plane takes corrective actions. For instance, if a Pod fails, it initiates the creation of a replacement Pod to ensure that the desired state is maintained.\n",

Similar to the `kube-controller-manager`, the `cloud-controller-manager` is responsible for maintaining the desired state of these cloud resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `cloud-controller-manager` may include controllers like the *node controller*, which queries the cloud provider to assess the health and status of nodes in the cluster. It makes decisions based on cloud-specific information, ensuring that the cluster can effectively adapt to changing conditions, such as instances being terminated or network configurations being adjusted."

    "\n",
    "1. `kube-apiserver` Communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The `kube-apiserver` serves as the central API endpoint for control plane components\n",
    "  - Node components, such as `kubelet` and `kube-proxy`, interact with it to access cluster information and synchronize the cluster state\n",

    "\n",
    "3. `kube-scheduler` Node Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The `kube-scheduler` uses data from `kube-apiserver` to make informed decisions about where to place new Pods\n",
    "  - It communicates its decisions to `kubelet` on the chosen Node, which then initiates the deployment of Pods, guided by the `PodSpec`\n",

    "Kubernetes offers two primary approaches to manage objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Declarative Commands**: Declarative commands specify the desired state of the cluster, describing what resources should exist and how they should behave. Kubernetes then takes care of ensuring the actual state matches this desired state. Declarative commands are favored for their predictability and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imperative Commands**: In contrast, imperative commands directly instruct Kubernetes to perform specific actions, such as creating, deleting, or updating resources. While imperative commands offer immediate control, they may require more manual intervention and can lead to *configuration drift* over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration drift refers to the unintended and gradual deviation between the desired configuration of a system and its actual state. This drift is more likely to occur with imperative commands because they can lead to untracked and immediate changes, making it challenging to maintain the intended configuration over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this section, we'll explore how to create these objects using declarative commands. \n",
    "\n",

    "- Which applications to deploy and where they should run within the cluster\n",
    "- The desired behavior of applications, including restart policies, scaling, upgrades, and more\n",
    "- Allocation of resources available to applications\n",
    "\n",
    "To create object, a request must be made to the Kubernetes API via the `kubelet-apiserver`. While it's possible to send direct requests, we'll leverage `kubectl` for most operations. However, before we request the creation of resources, we need to define the object's specifications."
