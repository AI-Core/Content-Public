    "# Kubernetes Storage & `StatefulSets`\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes has transformed the way we deploy and manage applications. While it excels at handling stateless workloads, dealing with stateful applications introduces unique challenges. In this lesson, we will delve into two critical aspects of Kubernetes that address these challenges: *Kubernetes Storage* and *`StatefulSets`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Kubernetes Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing data in Kubernetes requires careful consideration. Kubernetes offers various storage options to enable data persistence across containerized applications. From *Persistent Volumes (PVs)* to *Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)*, understanding these concepts is essential for ensuring data reliability and availability in your applications. We will cover these concepts in the next section in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of `StatefulSets`\n",
    "\n",
    "`StatefulSets`, a specialized controller in Kubernetes, are designed to handle stateful workloads with precision. They provide ordered, predictable deployment and scaling of pods, making them ideal for applications like databases, caching systems, and more. "

    "## Volumes in Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes in Kubernetes play a crucial role in managing data within containers, but they differ in several ways from their counterparts in Docker. Let's explore these differences and dive into the high-level features that make Kubernetes Volumes a powerful tool for managing data in containerized applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volumes in Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "In Docker, volumes are directories located on the host machine's disk or even within another container. These volumes can be mounted into containers during runtime, facilitating data sharing between containers or even across different host machines using drivers. While Docker volumes are valuable, they have limitations, especially when it comes to large-scale deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differentiators of Kubernetes Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes Volumes offer a more versatile and robust solution for managing data in containerized applications. Here are some high-level features that set Kubernetes Volumes apart:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simultaneous Mounting**: Kubernetes Volumes can be mounted simultaneously into multiple containers within the same Pod. This capability is particularly useful when you have multiple containers that need access to the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ephemeral and Persistent Volumes**: In Kubernetes, Volumes can be categorized as either ephemeral or persistent. *Ephemeral Volumes* have lifetimes tied to their Pods. When the Pod restarts or is rescheduled to a different node, ephemeral Volumes are recreated. On the other hand, *persistent Volumes* have lifetimes independent of their Pods. They offer durability and data retention even when Pods come and go.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic Data Availability**: Kubernetes takes care of ensuring that data is available across container restarts. This functionality is handled by `kubelet`, the Kubernetes node agent. It ensures that data remains accessible as long as the associated Volume exists, regardless of the Pod's state."

    "## Persistent Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes provides two key resources for managing persistent storage: `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim`. These resources abstract the provisioning and utilization of storage in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A `PersistentVolume` represents a storage volume in a cluster, provisioned by a cluster administrator. \n",
    "\n",
    "These volumes are similar to physical storage devices found on the host machine. Importantly, they exist independently of any specific pod's lifecycle. When bound to a pod, they function similarly to regular volumes, offering a reliable means of data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In contrast, a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is a user's request for the platform to create a `PersistentVolume` on their behalf. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, PVCs share similarities with pods in the sense that they consume resources. However, while pods request resources like CPU and RAM, PVCs specify storage requirements, including size and access modes (e.g., `read-write` or `read-only`).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Provisioning `PersistentVolume`s\n",
    "\n",
    "The provisioning of PersistentVolumes can occur through two primary methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Provisioning**: In this approach, cluster administrators pre-create PVs that are available for users to consume. Users then select a PV that matches their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Provisioning**: Dynamic provisioning is a more automated approach. When a user requests a PVC, the cluster attempts to dynamically provision an appropriate PV based on the PVC's requirements and `StorageClasses`. Dynamic provisioning ensures that PVs always match the requirements specified by PVCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reclaim Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a user is finished with a volume, they can initiate the deletion of the associated PVC, which subsequently triggers the reclamation of the underlying resource. Three reclaim policies govern how this resource reclamation occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retain**: The \"retain\" policy leaves the data intact, preserving both the `PersistentVolume` and any external storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delete**: The \"delete\" policy removes not only the `PersistentVolume` but also the external storage associated with it. This policy is the default for dynamic provisioning, though it can be configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recycle** (Deprecated): The \"recycle\" policy has been deprecated in favor of dynamic provisioning. Dynamic provisioning is now the recommended approach for creating and managing `PersistentVolumes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PersistentVolumes` can exist in one of four states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Available**: In this state, the `PersistentVolume` is ready to be bound to a pod, but it is not yet associated with any pod\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bound**: When a `PersistentVolume` is bound, it means that a PVC has been successfully associated with it, and it is actively serving a pod\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Released**: The \"released\" state occurs when a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is deleted, but the resource has not yet been reclaimed by the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Failed**: In the event that reclamation of a volume fails, it is marked as \"failed.\" This can happen due to various reasons, such as an issue with the storage system."

    "\n",
    "1. `.spec.capacity.storage`: In this example, we request 10GB of storage. The storage attribute allows you to specify the desired storage capacity. It's important to note that currently, only storage capacity can be requested. Kubernetes uses its resource model, which defines storage in units, to interpret the requested capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `.spec.volumeMode`: This attribute allows you to choose between two modes: FileSystem (default) or Block\n",
    "    - **FileSystem**: Represents a directory that can be mounted in pods, and it's the most commonly used mode\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Block**: Utilizes a raw block of storage without creating a filesystem on it. The Block mode is less common because applications need to know how to access raw data directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `.spec.accessModes`: This attribute specifies how data can be accessed by pods using the `PersistentVolume`. There are three common access modes:\n",
    "    - `ReadWriteOnce`: Allows a single Node to mount the volume with read-write access. This mode is suitable for scenarios where only only one pod needs read-write access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `ReadOnlyMany`: Permits multiple Nodes to mount the volume, but only read access is granted. Useful for scenarios where multiple pods need read-only access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `ReadWriteMany`: Similar to `ReadOnlyMany`, but grants read-write access to multiple nodes. Applications using this mode should handle possible data races.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `ReadWriteOncePod`: Provides read-write access but only for a single pod\n",
    "\n",
    "Access modes may behave differently depending on the type of `PersistentVolume` provider, and they should be chosen based on your application's requirements. A few of them are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/modes_providers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `.spec.storageClassName`: This attribute specifies the `StorageClass` associated with the `PersistentVolume`. If left unspecified, no `StorageClass` will be assigned to the `PersistentVolume`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `.spec.mountOptions`: This attribute is not supported by all types of `PersistentVolumes`. It specifies how the volume should be mounted, and in most cases, it can be left as is without the need for customization."

    "- **Data Sharing Consideration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Determine whether your data needs to be shared between containers or pods\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If sharing data between containers within the same pod, consider using ephemeral volumes for simple data exchange between applications\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If data needs to be shared between pods or preserved after pod termination, use `PersistentVolume`s\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Provisioning Decision**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Decide whether dynamic provisioning is required. This is particularly useful when it's challenging to predict the exact storage requirements in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without Dynamic Provisioning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a `PersistentVolume` `.yaml` configuration file (defines how a volume is created)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` `.yaml` configuration file (specifies how a volume is requested)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a `MyApplication .yaml` configuration file (the workload resource). Avoid using bare pods in your configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With Dynamic Provisioning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a `StorageClass` `.yaml` configuration file (acts as a template for providing `PersistentVolume`s to pods as needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expandable Volumes**:\n",
    "  - Consider using expandable volumes when you know the maximum number of pods that will run at any given time and the exact amount of storage required for each pod is unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic provisioning is beneficial for large-scale applications, where manual provisioning is impractical due to the following reasons:\n",
    "  - A high number of pods are requesting significant storage allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It's challenging to predict in advance how many pods will run\n",

    "## `StatefulSets`\n",
    "   \n",
    "In Kubernetes, workloads are typically used for stateless applications, where data is not written to external storage. However, when it comes to managing stateful applications, Kubernetes provides a powerful resource called `StatefulSets`.\n",

    "> `StatefulSets` are a specific type of workload resource in Kubernetes that adds a storage volume to each pod it manages.

    "- Volumes in Kubernetes provide a way to store and share data within containers. Volumes can be mounted simultaneously, making it easy to share data between containers within the same pod.\n",
    "- Persistent Volumes (PVs) are physical storage volumes in the cluster provisioned by administrators, while Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are requests for storage made by pods\n",
