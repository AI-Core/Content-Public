    "# Kubernetes Storage & Stateful Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes has transformed the way we deploy and manage applications. While it excels at handling *stateless* workloads, dealing with *stateful* applications introduces unique challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stateless applications** are designed without the reliance on persistent data or state information that needs to be maintained across multiple instances. They operate with the assumption that any instance of the application can handle any request without needing to access or store specific data. **Stateful applications**, on the other hand, introduce a unique set of challenges to Kubernetes. These applications maintain specific state information that must persist across instances and even during scaling or failover events.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will delve into two critical aspects of Kubernetes that address these challenges: *Kubernetes Storage* and *Stateful Sets*."

    "## Volumes in Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes in Kubernetes play a crucial role in managing data within containers, but they differ in several ways from their counterparts in Docker. In Docker, volumes are directories located on the host machine's disk or even within another container. These volumes can be mounted into containers during runtime, facilitating data sharing between containers or even across different host machines using drivers. While Docker volumes are valuable, they have limitations, especially when it comes to large-scale deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes Volumes offer a more versatile and robust solution for managing data in containerized applications. Here are some high-level features that set Kubernetes Volumes apart:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simultaneous Mounting**: Kubernetes Volumes can be mounted simultaneously into multiple containers within the same Pod. This capability is particularly useful when you have multiple containers that need access to the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ephemeral and Persistent Volumes**: In Kubernetes, Volumes can be categorized as either ephemeral or persistent. *Ephemeral Volumes* have lifetimes tied to their Pods. Whenever a Pod restarts or is reassigned to a different node, ephemeral Volumes are recreated. On the other hand, *persistent Volumes* have lifetimes independent of their Pods. They offer durability and data retention even when Pods come and go.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic Data Availability**: Kubernetes takes care of ensuring that data is available across container restarts. This functionality is handled by `kubelet`, the Kubernetes node agent. It ensures that data remains accessible as long as the associated Volume exists, regardless of the Pod's state."

    "## Kubernetes Volumes Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### `EmptyDir` Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`EmptyDir`* is the simplest volume type in Kubernetes. It creates a temporary storage volume that is tied to a Pod. When the Pod is deleted or rescheduled, the data stored in `EmptyDir` is lost. This volume is suitable for ephemeral data that is needed within a single Pod and does not need to persist across restarts or rescheduling events. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include storing temporary files or caches or sharing data among containers within the same Pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `HostPath` Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "> *`HostPath`* allows you to use a directory on the host machine as a source of data for a volume. It offers data persistence, but it comes with some limitations. The data stored with `HostPath` is specific to the host where the Pod is running. This means that data may not be available if the Pod is rescheduled to a different node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include accessing host-specific data and running stateful applications that rely on host-specific resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at an example `HostPath`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Pod\n",
    "metadata:\n",
    "  name: hostpath-pod\n",
    "spec:\n",
    "  containers:\n",
    "  - name: my-container\n",
    "    image: my-application-image\n",
    "    volumeMounts:\n",
    "    - name: hostpath-volume\n",
    "      mountPath: /app-config\n",
    "  volumes:\n",

    "    hostPath:\n",

    "```\n",
    "In this example, in the `volumes` section, we define the `hostpath-volume`. It uses the `hostPath` volume type and specifies the path as `/data/host-specific-data`. This path points to the directory on the host machine that contains the configuration files we need for our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `volumeMounts` section under the container, which allows us to mount a volume into the container, we mount the `hostpath-volume` to the path `/app-config` within the container. This means that the contents of the `host-specific-data` directory on the host will be accessible to the container at `/app-config`."

    "### Persistent Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "While `HostPath` volumes are primarily used for data persistence within a single node, *Persistent Volumes* are designed to provide data persistence that transcends the lifecycle of individual pods. Kubernetes provides two key resources for managing persistent storage: `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim`. These resources abstract the provisioning and utilization of storage in your cluster. Common use cases for these volumes are running stateful applications that require persistent data, and managing shared storage resources for multiple Pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A `PersistentVolume` represents a storage volume in a cluster, provisioned by a cluster administrator. \n",
    "\n",
    "These volumes are similar to physical storage devices found on the host machine. Importantly, they exist independently of any specific pod's lifecycle. When bound to a pod, they function similarly to regular volumes, offering a reliable means of data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In contrast, a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is a user's request for the platform to create a `PersistentVolume` on their behalf. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, PVCs share similarities with pods in the sense that they consume resources. However, while pods request resources like CPU and RAM, PVCs specify storage requirements, including size and access modes (e.g., `read-write` or `read-only`).\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Provisioning Persistent Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "The provisioning of Persistent Volumes can occur through two primary methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Provisioning**: In this approach, cluster administrators pre-create PVs that are available for users to consume. Users then select a PV that matches their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Provisioning**: Dynamic provisioning is a more automated approach. When a user requests a PVC, the cluster attempts to dynamically provision an appropriate PV based on the PVC's requirements. Dynamic provisioning ensures that PVs always match the requirements specified by PVCs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reclaim Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a user is finished with a volume, they can initiate the deletion of the associated PVC, which subsequently triggers the reclamation of the underlying resource. Three reclaim policies govern how this resource reclamation occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retain**: The *retain policy* leaves the data intact, preserving both the `PersistentVolume` and any external storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delete**: The *delete policy* removes not only the `PersistentVolume` but also the external storage associated with it\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recycle** (Deprecated): The *recycle policy* has been deprecated in favor of dynamic provisioning. Dynamic provisioning is now the recommended approach for creating and managing `PersistentVolumes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PersistentVolumes` can exist in one of four states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Available**: In this state, the `PersistentVolume` is ready to be bound to a pod, but it is not yet associated with any pod\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bound**: When a `PersistentVolume` is bound, it means that a PVC has been successfully associated with it, and it is actively serving a pod\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Released**: The released state occurs when a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is deleted, but the resource has not yet been reclaimed by the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Failed**: In the event that reclamation of a volume fails, it is marked as failed. This can happen due to various reasons."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Volumes in Kubernetes provide a way to store and share data within containers. Volumes can be mounted simultaneously, making it easy to share data between containers within the same pod or between pods.\n",
    "- `EmptyDir` volumes provide a way to create temporary storage within a pod. They are primarily used for sharing files and data between containers running within the same pod.\n",
    "- Data stored in an `EmptyDir` volume is ephemeral and tied to the lifecycle of the pod. When the pod is deleted or rescheduled to a different node, the data is lost.\n",
    "- `HostPath` volumes allow pods to use a directory on the host machine as a source of data for a volume. Data is persisted on the host machine.\n",
    "- `HostPath` volumes are used for accessing host-specific data or resources. The data stored with `HostPath` is specific to the host where the pod is running.\n",
    "- Persistent Volumes (PVs) are physical storage volumes in the cluster provisioned by administrators, while Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are requests for storage made by pods\n",
    "- Storage Classes define the classes of storage offered by administrators and can be used to dynamically provision storage. Different provisioners can be used with Storage Classes, enabling flexibility in choosing storage solutions.\n",
    "- Dynamic provisioning allows Kubernetes to automatically create PVs based on PVC requirements, making it suitable for large-scale deployments. It eliminates the need for manual provisioning and ensures that storage matches the demands of pods.\n",
    "- Expandable volumes can be used when the maximum number of pods running simultaneously is known, but the exact storage requirements per pod are uncertain. \n",
    "- Stateful Sets are workload resources used for stateful applications that require persistent storage. They manage pods with storage volumes, ensuring data persistence even across pod restarts.\n",
    "- Stateful Sets require a headless Service to manage network identity\n",
    "- Deleting a Stateful Set does not automatically delete associated storage to preserve data"
