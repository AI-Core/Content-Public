    "> *Amazon S3*, also known as Simple Storage Service, is a scalable and highly available object storage service provided by AWS. Its primary purpose is to store and retrieve large amounts of data reliably, securely, and cost-effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> IMPORTANT: Though AWS S3 is part of the AWS Free Tier there are some limitations, so you will get charged for AWS S3 if your use it outside the Free Tier usage. The Free Tier usage will include 12 months of 5GB of storage 20,000 to retrieve data from S3 and 20,00 requests to send data to S3. The details of pricing outside of this usage can be found at the following [link](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/). Remember to close any AWS resources after use if using your own AWS account. "

    "## Buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon S3 uses a hierarchical structure for organizing data, starting with *buckets* as the top-level containers. Within these buckets, *objects* are stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **bucket** in Amazon S3 is like a top-level folder or directory that holds objects, which can be files, documents, images, or any other form of data. Buckets act as logical containers for organizing and storing your data within S3. Each bucket has a globally unique name, following specific naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a bucket in Amazon S3, you need to choose a unique name that complies with the S3 naming rules. The naming rules for Amazon S3 buckets are as follows:\n",
    "- Bucket names must be unique globally across all existing buckets in Amazon S3\n",
    "- Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long\n",
    "- Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (`-`)\n",
    "- Bucket names must start and end with a lowercase letter or number\n",
    "- Bucket names cannot contain underscores (`_`), uppercase letters, spaces, or any other special characters\n",
    "- Bucket names should not resemble IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.5.4) to avoid potential conflicts with virtual-hosted-style access\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to select a meaningful name that reflects the content or purpose of the bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a S3 bucket:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your admin IAM user and navigate to the Amazon S3 service in the search bar. You will be met with the S3 service home page. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/S3Home.png\" width=\"900\" height=\"550\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click on the **Create bucket** to begin the bucket creation process\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You will be redirected to the bucket creation page, where you will need to provide the following information:\n",
    "   - **Bucket Name**: Enter a unique and meaningful name for your bucket that adheres to the naming rules mentioned earlier\n",
    "   - **Region**: Select the AWS region where you want your bucket to reside. Consider factors such as data locality, compliance requirements, and latency when choosing the region. You should choose a region geographically close to you, such as `eu-west-1` for the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/CreateBucketmaya.png\" width=\"900\" height=\"550\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Object Ownership**: The **Object Ownership** tab allows you to configure object ownership settings, such as bucket owner preference for access control lists (ACLs). We will learn about ACLs in a later section, but ACLs can be configured both during bucket creation and after the bucket has been created. For now leave the recommended selection ticked.\n",
    "   - **Other Configure Options**: There are a couple of additional configurations, such as public access, tags, encryption options that we will keep as default to create this bucket. We will describe them in more detail in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Leave the rest of the configurations as default, and click on the **Create bucket** button to create the bucket\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Objects** tab displays a list of objects stored within the bucket. It provides an overview of the object names, sizes, and other relevant details. From here, you can upload new objects, create folders (known as prefixes), and perform actions on individual objects, such as deleting, copying, or downloading them. We will discuss objects in details in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Properties** tab displays information about the bucket, including its name, region, storage class, and encryption settings. It also allows you to configure additional properties such as versioning, logging, event notifications, and tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bucket Versioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon S3 offers a feature called *versioning*, which allows you to keep multiple versions of an object within an S3 bucket. Enabling versioning at the bucket level provides enhanced data protection, recovery options, and enables auditing and compliance requirements. Here are some key points to understand about bucket versioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enabling Versioning**: Versioning can be enabled at the bucket level, meaning that all objects within the bucket will have versioning applied once it is enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versioning Behavior**: Once versioning is enabled for a bucket, every write operation (e.g., uploading, modifying, or deleting an object) creates a new version of the object, including the initial version. Each version is assigned a unique version ID that can be used to identify and access specific versions of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Object Versions**: You can access specific versions of an object by specifying the version ID when making API requests or through the S3 Management Console. By default, when retrieving an object without specifying a version ID, the latest version of the object is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versioning provides an added layer of data protection, as it helps protect against accidental deletion, overwrites, or malicious actions. It enables recovery of previous versions of an object if needed, serving as a backup mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Versioning can impact storage costs, as each version of an object consumes storage space. Be mindful of the storage costs when using versioning extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versioning can also affect performance and data transfer costs, as retrieving older versions or listing all versions incurs additional operations and network transfer."

    "\n",
    "#### **1. ACLs**\n",
    "\n",
    "ACLs allow you to manage permissions at both the bucket and object level. With ACLs, you can define who has access to your buckets and objects and specify the type of access they have. The following are some key aspects of ACLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bucket-level ACLs**: You can set permissions on the bucket itself, allowing you to control who can perform operations like listing objects, uploading, and deleting objects in the bucket. Permissions can be granted to specific AWS accounts or predefined groups, such as the bucket owner, authenticated users, or everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-level ACLs**: ACLs can be applied to individual objects within a bucket, providing fine-grained control over access. Object-level ACLs allow you to grant or revoke permissions for specific objects to different AWS accounts or groups, enabling you to secure sensitive data or grant temporary access to specific objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Granting public access**: ACLs also provide the option to grant public access to objects, making them accessible to anyone with the object's URL. This can be useful for hosting publicly available content, such as static websites or publicly shared files. However, caution must be exercised when granting public access to prevent unintentional exposure of sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Enabling ACLs**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the Bucket Home Page, click on the **Object Ownership** tab\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enable ACLs by acknowledging that enabling this feature will restore default ownership for existing objects, then click **Save changes**\n",

Given this is your personal bucket we will keep the default ACL settings, but now you how you can change them if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ACL settings for an Amazon S3 bucket, you will encounter the following options:\n",
    "- **Bucket Owner**: The AWS account that owns the bucket and has full control over it\n",
    "- **Everyone**: Refers to the general public or anonymous users\n",

    "\n",
    "Bucket policies are `JSON`-based access control policies that enable you to define fine-grained access rules for your S3 buckets. Using bucket policies, you can specify conditions, control access based on IP addresses, or restrict access to specific IAM users or roles. Bucket policies are powerful tools for implementing advanced access control configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a step-by-step walkthrough of setting up a bucket policy that grants our previously created `John` IAM user (see IAM lesson) read-only access to our bucket:\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the Policy Generator, set the following parameters:\n",
    "   - Select **S3 Bucket Policy** as the policy type\n",
    "   - Under **Principal** you will need to copy the ARN of the `John` IAM user. You can retrieve this from the IAM console accessing `John`'s IAM user Home Page under **Summary**.\n",
    "   - Choose the desired actions, in our case for read-only access to the bucket those will be: `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject`. Select these from the drop down menu under **Actions**. By granting these permissions, users will be able to see the list of objects in the bucket and retrieve the object data without the ability to modify or delete any objects.\n",
    "   - Specify the ARN of your bucket as the resource. You can find the bucket ARN under the Bucket Home Page, in the **Properties** tab. You should specify two ARNs here separated by comma (no white spaces): `arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}` and `arn:aws:s3:::{your-bucket-name}/*`. The first ARN refers to the bucket itself, while the second one refers to all objects within the specified buckets, which is needed for the `s3:GetObject` action.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you have configured the desired policy in the Policy Generator, click on the **Add Statement** button. This will show you the statement you have generated.\n",
