    "## Virtualization and Instances in EC2\n",
    "\n",
    "> Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of hardware, operating systems, storage devices, and other resources. In the context of EC2, virtualization allows for the creation of virtual servers called **instances** that run on AWS infrastructure. It abstracts the underlying physical hardware, enabling multiple instances to run concurrently on the same physical server, thereby maximizing resource utilization and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EC2 Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "> An EC2 instance represents a virtual server in the cloud. It is a self-contained unit that includes virtual CPUs, memory, storage, and network interfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you launch an EC2 instance, you essentially create a virtual machine that runs on AWS's highly available and scalable infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance is isolated from other instances running on the same physical server, providing a secure and independent environment. EC2 instances are designed to be reliable and configurable, allowing users to tailor the instance specifications to meet their specific workload requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main advantages of using instances rather than traditional machines are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ability to Choose Hardware Configurations**: EC2 provides a wide range of instance types with different hardware configurations. This includes variations in CPU power, memory capacity, storage capabilities, and network performance. Users can select the instance type that best aligns with their application's resource requirements, optimizing performance and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility in Operating Systems and Software**: EC2 supports a variety of operating systems, including popular options like Amazon Linux, Windows Server, and various distributions of Linux. Additionally, users have the flexibility to install and configure software of their choice, ensuring compatibility with their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability and Elasticity**: EC2 instances can be easily scaled up or down based on demand. This elasticity allows applications to handle variable workloads and adapt to changing requirements. *Auto Scaling*, a feature of EC2, enables automatic instance provisioning and termination based on predefined scaling policies, ensuring optimal resource utilization. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Resource Utilization**: With virtualization, multiple EC2 instances can run on a single physical server, enabling better utilization of computing resources. This leads to cost savings, as you pay only for the resources used by your instances and maximize the efficiency of the underlying infrastructure.\n"

    "In the EC2 Dashboard, click on the **Launch Instance** button to begin the instance creation process. Alternatively you can first navigate to the **Instances (running)** tab from the EC2 home page and select the **Launch instances** button from the instances home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Selecting an AMI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Launch an instance** page you will first have to name for your instance that will allow you to easily identify it within your AWS account. Let's name this `my-first-EC2-instance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)** section, select the desired *Amazon Machine Image (AMI)*.\n",

    "\n",
    "> In Amazon EC2, a *key pair* is a secure method of accessing your EC2 instances. It consists of a *public key* and a corresponding *private key*. The public key is used to encrypt data that can only be decrypted using the private key. Key pairs are essential for establishing secure remote access to your EC2 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "When launching an EC2 instance, you have the option to create a new key pair or use an existing one. If creating a new key pair, you generate a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The private key is stored on your local machine, while the public key is associated with the EC2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To securely access your EC2 instance after creation, you will use the private key to authenticate yourself. The public key associated with the instance is stored on the instance itself, allowing it to authenticate the private key when you attempt to connect.\n",

    "##### **Importance of Key Pairs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key pairs provide a secure and encrypted method for remote access to your EC2 instances. By using a key pair, you eliminate the need to transmit passwords over the network, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Key pairs play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of your EC2 instances and the data they hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Pair Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to securely store your private key and prevent unauthorized access to it. If you lose your private key, you may be unable to access your EC2 instance. In such cases, you may need to create a new key pair and associate it with a new instance or use other recovery methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For our example walkthrough we will create a new key pair. You will only need to give the key pair a name and then click on the **Create key pair** button. You might then be prompted to a pop-up that asks you if you want to allow downloads from the AWS console. Allowing this will save the newly created key pair locally. We will need this later to connect to the EC2 instance once it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8. Launch the Instance\n",
