The free tier usage will include 12 months of 5GB of storage 20,000 to retrieve data from S3 and 20,00 requests to send data to S3. The details of pricing outside of this usage can be found at the following [link](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/). If you require S3 for any projects on the course one will be provided for you.
