       "AWS RDS is a service that allows you to create a database in the cloud. This database is highly scalable and has a variety of uses.

       "\n",
       "First if you haven't already configured your own security group on AWS, you will need to create a security group for our database. Security groups act as a virtual firewall to protect any resources on your AWS account from outside traffic as well as blocking outgoing traffic to unverified sources. We will need to preconfigure one before creating the database so we can attach it the database after creation. This will allow the control of traffic flowing into and out of the database. \n",

       "By default the security group has no rules allowing inbound traffic but is configured to allow all outbound traffic. This can be seen under the `Outbound rules` the type is configured with `All traffic` which means all ports and protocols possible. The destination is set to custom with `0.0.0.0/0` set as the destination, the IPv4 address `0.0.0.0/0` is a placeholder that represents all possible `IPv4` addresses. \n",

       "`IPv4` addresses are the most common form of IP addresses represented in the form `x.x.x.x` each `x` can take on values between 0 and 255 to represent a unique address on the internet. So addresses can range from `0.0.0.0` all the way to `255.255.255.255` an example might be the address `88.23.101.192`. The `/0` at the end of the IP addresses represents the CIDR(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) it can range between the values 0 to 32. This number represents a range of IP addresses from one IP address all the way up to 4,294,967,296(every possible) IPv4 address. For a personal computer this value will be `/32` which represents one IP address for bigger companies they might have a value like `/21` which gives them access to 2,048 possible IP addresses. \n",

       "The new form of IP addresses IPv6, have the form `FE80:CD00:0000:0CDE:1257:0000:211E:729C` though aren't commonly used yet. They can represent up to 340 trillion trillion trillion different IP addresses. They will be more common in the future since believe it or not we're running out of IPv4 IP addresses.\n",
