    "## Generating an Access Key and Secret Access Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To use AWS CLI, you need to generate an access key and secret access key, which serve as your credentials for accessing AWS resources. If you haven't completed the **Practice** section in the IAM lesson, make sure to do this first, as we will generate an access and secret access key for the `AdministratorAccess` user you have created there. Here's how you can generate these keys through the AWS Management Console:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your admin IAM user account credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to the IAM console and select the user you are logged in as. This is the user for whom we want to generate the access and secret access key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the user summary page select the **Security credentials** tab. Scroll down to the **Access keys** section and click on the **Create access key** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will be redirected to the **Access key best practices & alternatives** page. On this page, you will be asked to provide a use case for the access key. Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Check the box that reads **I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key** to confirm that you understand the best practices and still wish to create an access key\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Continue and the click **Create access key**. You will then be directed to the **Retrieve acsess keys** page, where the access key and secret access key will be displayed. Take note of these credentials, as they are required for configuring AWS CLI. You should also click on the **Download .csv file** button to save the credentials securely. This is important because the secret access key will not be shown again for security reasons. If you do not download and save the credentials, you will need to generate a new access key and secret access key in the future.\n",

    "To list all IAM users in your AWS account, you can run: `aws iam list-users`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/ListUsers.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is in `JSON` format and represents information about two IAM users: `John` and `Maya`. Let's understand the information presented for each `John`:\n",
    "- `Path`: The path of the IAM user within the AWS account (`/` denotes the root level)\n",
    "- `UserName`: The username associated with the IAM user (`John` in this case)\n",
    "- `UserId`: The unique identifier for the IAM user \n",
    "- `Arn`: The ARN that uniquely identifies the IAM user's resource location \n",
    "- `CreateDate`: The date and time when the IAM user was created\n",
    "- `PasswordLastUsed`: The date and time when the IAM user last used their password \n",
    "\n",
    "To describe detailed information about a specific IAM user, you can run: `aws iam get-user --user-name <user-name>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Creating and Deleting IAM Users:\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new IAM user, you can run: `aws iam create-user --user-name <user-name>`. To delete an existing IAM user, you can run: `aws iam delete-user --user-name <user-name>`.\n",
