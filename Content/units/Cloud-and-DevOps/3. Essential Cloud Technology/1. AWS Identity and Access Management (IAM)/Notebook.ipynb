    "\n",
    "> **IAM users** are entities within AWS that represent individual users, applications, or services that interact with AWS resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "IAM users in AWS have distinct identities that are linked to their associated credentials, such as a username and password or *access keys*. These users are assigned specific roles that determine their permissions to perform actions on AWS resources. These permissions are carefully granted to ensure users have the necessary access to fulfill their tasks. We will talk about all the concepts introduced here throughout the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-On: Creating an IAM User\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an IAM user, you can use the AWS Management Console, *AWS CLI*, or *AWS SDKs*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)** is a tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands from your local computer's command line. We will learn more about the AWS CLI and how to provision it in the next lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "**AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)** are libraries and APIs provided by AWS to help developers integrate AWS services into their applications, making it easier to programmatically interact with services like IAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the AWS Management Console to create a user:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console. You can do this by either typing **IAM** in the search bar or accessing IAM directly from the **Services** tab. You will be meet with the following page:\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/IAM-console.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click on **Users** in the navigation pane and then on **Add User** to create a new IAM user\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provide a username for the user (e.g., `John`) and select **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console**. If you don't select this option, the user will only have *Programmatic access*, meaning it will be able to interact with AWS services programmatically through the AWS CLI or SDKs. This type of user is normally used for automation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Under **User type** select **I want to create an IAM user**, this will allow your user to have both Management Console and programmatic access. This will be useful in the next lesson when we will learn how to setup AWS CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For password, you have the option to choose between an **Autogenerated password** or a **Custom password**. If you select the first option the system will generate a random password for the user and you will be able to view the password after creating the user. If you select the later you can provide a password of your choice. It's up to you to decide which option you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Select **Users must create a new password at the next sign-in** to allow the user to choose their preferred password on the first login \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Click **Next** and follow the prompts to configure additional settings if needed. For this hands-on we will not set any permissions yet, so feel free to click **Next** in the **Set permissions** tab.\n",

    "## IAM Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IAM policies** are `JSON` documents that define *IAM permissions*, specifying allowed or denied actions on AWS resources. Policies consist of statements that include the effect (*allow* or *deny*), the actions permitted or denied, the affected resources, and optional conditions for access granting or restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle of Least Privilege\n",
    "\n",
    "> The *principle of least privilege* in IAM permissions refers to the practice of granting users or entities only the minimum level of access and permissions necessary to perform their specific tasks or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a company with multiple employees, each responsible for different tasks within your AWS environment. Some employees need access to your Amazon S3 buckets to upload and download files, while others need to manage your EC2 instances or configure your database. Don't worry about the terminology of different services here, as we will cover them in detail in later lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, without IAM, granting access to these resources would be challenging. You would have to share the same credentials, such as the AWS account username and password, with all employees. This approach poses significant security risks because it means giving everyone full access to all your resources, including the ability to modify or delete critical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with IAM, you can enforce the *principle of least privilege*. Let's say you have an employee named Sarah who works as a developer and needs access to your EC2 instances. Instead of giving her full administrative rights, you can create an IAM user account specifically for her and assign her only the necessary permissions to manage EC2 instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for another employee named John, who is responsible for managing your database, you can create a separate IAM user account and assign him permissions to interact with your database service, such as creating and deleting database instances, but without providing access to other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "By granting these granular permissions, you ensure that each employee has access only to the resources required for their respective tasks. This practice significantly reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of your resources. If, in the future, Sarah no longer needs access to EC2 instances, you can simply revoke her permissions within IAM without affecting any other aspect of your AWS environment.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Access keys** are long-term credentials used to authenticate programmatic access to AWS services via API calls, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Each access key consists of an *access key ID* and a *secret access key*. These keys are used to securely sign requests sent to AWS services, allowing users to interact programmatically with AWS resources.\n",

    "### Managing Access and Secret Access Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Access and secret access keys can be generated for IAM users to provide programmatic access. The keys should be securely managed and stored. IAM users can create and manage their own access keys, or administrators can generate them on behalf of users. It's important to regularly rotate access keys to maintain security best practices and minimize the potential impact of compromised credentials."

    "Creating an IAM user with administrator access is a recommended practice to perform various tasks in AWS. Using an IAM user with administrator access improves security by limiting exposure of the root credentials, which are highly privileged and more vulnerable to security breaches. It enables granular access control by assigning specific permissions for different tasks, and additional IAM users can be created with limited permissions to adhere to the principle of least privilege. \n",

    "## IAM Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Creating Strong and Secure Passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating IAM users, it is essential to encourage the use of strong and unique passwords. Strong passwords should be long, contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information, such as names or birthdays. Regularly remind users to update their passwords and avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Factor Authentication** adds an extra layer of security to IAM user accounts. By requiring an additional authentication factor, such as a one-time password generated by a virtual MFA device, MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if the user's password is compromised. Encourage the use of MFA for all IAM users, especially for accounts with elevated privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Regularly Reviewing and Auditing IAM Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Periodically reviewing and auditing IAM permissions is crucial to maintain the principle of least privilege and ensure that users have only the necessary access. Regularly review IAM policies, user permissions, and group memberships to identify any excessive or outdated permissions. Remove or modify permissions as needed to align with user roles and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Implementing IAM Password Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "IAM password policies allow you to enforce specific password requirements across your AWS account. Consider implementing policies that enforce password complexity rules, require password rotation at regular intervals, and prevent password reuse. By implementing strong password policies, you enhance the overall security of IAM user accounts."

    "- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial service for managing user access and permissions within AWS environments\n",
    "- IAM allows you to enforce the principle of least privilege by granting and revoking granular permissions to users and entities, ensuring they have only the necessary access required for their specific tasks\n",
    "- Creating IAM users enables individual users, applications, or services to interact with AWS resources, and IAM groups provide a convenient way to manage permissions for users with similar roles or responsibilities\n",
    "- IAM policies, defined in `JSON `format, specify the permissions granted or denied for IAM users, groups, or roles. They determine what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources.\n",
    "- Best practices for IAM include creating strong and secure passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), regularly reviewing and auditing permissions, implementing IAM password policies, and considering federating AWS access with external identity providers"
