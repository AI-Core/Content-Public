    "## Install and Configure Azure Data Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin your journey with Azure Data Studio, you need to download and install it on your local machine. For the examples given throughout this lesson I will be using the VMs from the **SQL Server on Azure VMs** lesson, as this virtual machine has a local SQL Server database set up already and we will use that later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Azure Data Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Azure Data Studio follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
