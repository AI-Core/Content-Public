    "*Azure Storage* is a cloud-based object storage solution offered by Microsoft Azure. It provides highly scalable and durable cloud storage for a wide variety of data types, including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Azure Storage supports multiple data access methods and can be used for a wide range of use cases, such as file sharing, backup and recovery, archiving, and disaster recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features of Azure Storage are:\n",
    "- **Scalability and Durability**: Azure Storage is highly scalable and provides multiple layers of redundancy to ensure your data is protected against hardware failures and other types of data loss\n",
    "- **Multiple Data Access Methods**: Azure Storage supports multiple data access methods, including *Blob storage*, *File storage*, *Queue storage*, and *Table storage*, making it versatile for different use cases\n",
    "- **Security**: Azure Storage provides encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and Azure Active Directory integration to protect your data (we will talk more about Azure Active Directory in a later lesson)\n",
    "- **Integration with Azure Services**: Azure Storage is integrated with other Azure services, allowing you to easily store and manage data for your applications"

    "\n",
    "Azure Storage provides four different types of storage:\n",
    "- **Blob Storage**: Blob storage is designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, and documents. Blob storage supports both block and page blobs, and provides different tiers of storage to meet different performance and cost requirements.\n",
    "- **File Storage**: File storage is designed for storing and sharing files. It is optimized for enterprise applications that require file sharing, such as media and entertainment, and provides fully managed file shares that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.\n",
    "- **Queue Storage**: Queue storage is designed for storing and processing messages between applications. It provides a reliable messaging solution that can be used to build scalable, decoupled applications.\n",
    "- **Table Storage**: Table storage is designed for storing large amounts of structured data, such as customer data, device data, and logs. It provides a NoSQL key-value store that can scale to handle billions of entities."

    "## Blob Storage Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Blob storage is organized into three main components: *account*, *container*, and *blob*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Account**\n",
    "An Azure Storage account is the top-level object that provides a unique namespace for your data. It is the starting point for accessing and managing your data in Blob storage, as well as other storage services such as Queue storage and Table storage. \n",
    "> When you create a storage account, you specify a globally unique name and select the data center region where the account will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Container**\n",
    "A container is a logical grouping of blobs within a storage account. It provides a way to organize your data and control access to it. You can create multiple containers within a storage account, and each container can hold an unlimited number of blobs. \n",
    "> When you create a container, you specify a unique name within the storage account and set access policies that control who can access the container and its blobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Blob**\n",
    "A blob is a binary large object that can be any type of data, such as a text file, image, or video. Blobs are stored within containers in a storage account and can be accessed using a unique URL. When you create a blob, you specify its type (such as block blob, page blob, or append blob) and set properties such as metadata and access policies. Blobs can be uploaded and downloaded using a variety of tools and APIs, and can be accessed directly via HTTP/HTTPS URLs."

    "## Blob Storage Tiers and Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "Blob storage offers three storage tiers to optimize cost and performance for different types of data:\n",
    "- *Hot Tier*: The hot tier is designed for frequently accessed data with low latency requirements. It provides high-performance storage optimized for read and write operations, and offers the lowest data retrieval fees.\n",
    "- *Cool Tier*: The cool tier is designed for data that is accessed less frequently, but still requires fast access times. It provides a lower storage cost compared to the hot tier, and is ideal for backup, archive, and infrequently accessed workloads.\n",
    "- *Archive Tier*: The archive tier is designed for long-term retention of rarely accessed data with low retrieval requirements. It provides the lowest storage among the tiers, but has the highest data retrieval fees. The archive tier is ideal for compliance and regulatory requirements, and workloads with extremely low access frequency."
