    "\n",
    "Resource groups can be used to organize resources based on a project, department, or any other criteria. By grouping resources into resource groups, you can manage and monitor them collectively. Resource groups can also be used for access control and billing purposes. You can assign access permissions to a resource group, which will be inherited by all the resources within it. All resources in a resource group must share the same lifecycle, and they can be deployed, updated, and deleted as a group."

    "- All resources in a resource group must share the same lifecycle, and they can be deployed, updated, and deleted as a group\n",
    "- To create a resource group, you need to specify a name, subscription, and region\n",
