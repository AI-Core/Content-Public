    "\n",
    "- **2. Creating Databases**: To create a new database, right-click on the **Databases** node in the Object Explorer and select **New Database**. Enter the database name, set its properties like file locations and size, and configure options such as collation and recovery model. Let's create a new database named `SampleDB` with the default settings.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **3. Table Design and Creation**: To create a new table, expand the **Tables** node under the target database, right-click, and choose **New Table**. Use the Table Designer to define table columns, data types, constraints, and set primary keys and foreign keys.\n",
    "Alternatively, users can write SQL scripts using the **New Query** option to create tables. As an example, we will create a new table named `Employees` within the `SampleDB` database. The table will have the following columns: `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Salary`.\n",

    "You will be asked to give the table a name, and then you will be able to see it under the **Tables** node once you have refreshed this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4. Data Import and Export**: SSMS allows users to import data from various sources into SQL Server databases and export data to different file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5. Query Execution**: With SSMS, users can execute SQL queries against SQL Server databases. Write T-SQL queries in the **New Query** window and execute them to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identify the Backup Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Before restoring a database, ensure that you have the necessary backup files available. Backup files in SQL Server have a `.bak` extension. Identify the full backup file, and if applicable, any differential and transaction log backup files. As an example we will use the following [`.bak` file](https://aicore-portal-public-prod-307050600709.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lesson_files/8d59241f-64a9-4d89-9d36-e8f331a0bc53/sales_database.bak) from a sample database for SQL Server provided by Microsoft. Make sure to download this file locally on your Azure VM. Once you downloaded this file you will have to copy it to `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\\MSSQL\\Backup` or the equivalent SQL Server folder on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Connect to SQL Server\n",

    "### Step 3: Initiate Database Restore\n",
    "\n",
    "Right-click on the **Databases** node in the Object Explorer, and then choose **Restore Database..**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Select the Source\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Restore Database** window, choose the **Device** option and click the **...** button to select the backup files to restore. Click the **Add** button to navigate to the location of the backup files, select the appropriate full backup, and if needed, the differential and transaction log backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Choose the Restore Options\n",
    "\n",
    "On the General page, ensure that the destination database name is correct. Optionally, specify a new database name if you want to restore with a different name. Click **OK** to perform the restoration. Once the restore has been completed you will be met with a message as the following: **Database restored successfully**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the restoration completes successfully, the database will be available for use or further data retrieval. You should be able to see the restored database together with all its tables and data under the Object Explorer pane now.\n",
