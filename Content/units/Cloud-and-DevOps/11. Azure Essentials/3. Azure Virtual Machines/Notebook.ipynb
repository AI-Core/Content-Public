    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: You can quickly provision new virtual machines as your business needs change\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: You can choose from a wide range of virtual machine sizes, operating systems, and software configurations\n",

    "Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are built on a virtualized infrastructure that consists of multiple layers. At the lowest level is the physical server hardware. Above that is the *hypervisor layer*, which is responsible for creating and managing the virtual machines. The hypervisor isolates the virtual machines from each other and from the underlying hardware, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on the same physical server, also known as *VM density*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each virtual machine runs its own operating system, which is referred to as the *guest operating system*. The **guest operating system** interacts with the **hypervisor layer** to access the physical resources of the underlying hardware. The **hypervisor layer** also provides the virtual machine with a set of virtual hardware devices, such as virtual CPUs, virtual network adapters, and virtual disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above the **hypervisor layer** is the *host operating system layer*. The **host operating system** runs on the physical server and provides a platform for managing the virtual machines. It is responsible for tasks such as resource allocation, virtual machine monitoring, and virtual machine management.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Azure VMs are **unmanaged**, which means that you are responsible for managing the operating system and applications running on the virtual machine. However, Azure provides tools and services that make it easier to manage virtual machines at scale, such as Azure Automation and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets."
