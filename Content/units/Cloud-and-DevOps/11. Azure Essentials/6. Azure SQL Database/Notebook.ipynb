It provides a fully-managed environment for hosting SQL databases in the cloud, eliminating the need for on-premises hardware and maintenance. \n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson aims to help you harness the power of cloud-based databases in Microsoft Azure - specifically, Azure SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. These services offer a reliable, flexible, and secure way to manage data in the cloud. By learning how to create and configure Azure SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplify Data Management**: You don't need to worry about hardware or maintenance. Focus on designing databases and building applications instead.\n",
    "- **Scale with Ease**: Easily adjust resources to handle varying workloads without downtime\n",
    "- **Ensure Data Availability**: Automatic backups, replication, and failover mechanisms keep your data safe and available, even in emergencies\n",
    "- **Boost Security and Compliance**: Benefit from strong security features and comply with data regulations"

    "## Create an Azure SQL Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's being by creating an Azure SQL Database. To do this start by typing **SQL databases** in the search bar of the Azure portal. Select its corresponding page, this will redirect you to the following page:\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/SQLDatabases.png\" height=\"550\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a SQL database click on the **Create** button, and begin filling in the required information. For **Subscription** we will select the subscription associated with our account, and for **Resource group** we will create a new one called `my-database-rg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will define the database name under the **Database details** pane. We need to set up the server that's going to be the underlying infrastructure of our database. Currently we don't have any server existing in our subscription:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/EmptyServerList.png\" height=\"600\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a SQL Database Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can create an Azure SQL database, you need to create a new SQL database server. A database server is a logical container for your databases, and provides a centralized location to manage your database resources. We will create a new server using the **Create new** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a new SQL database server in Azure, you will need to provide a server name. The server name is a unique identifier for your database server that is used to access the server and the databases within it. The server name can be up to 63 characters in length and must contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The server name must be globally unique across all Azure SQL database servers, so you may need to try a few different names before finding one that is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing you will need to do is select the location where the server will be created. As usual, make sure to select the region that's geographically closest to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL Database Server Authentication Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure SQL Database supports two primary authentication methods: Azure Active Directory authentication and SQL Server authentication. Here's a brief overview of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Azure Active Directory Authentication*: Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication is an identity and access management service that provides a centralized location for managing user identities and access to Azure resources. With AAD authentication, users can log in to Azure SQL Database using their Azure AD credentials, eliminating the need for separate SQL Server credentials.\n",
    "- *SQL Server Authentication*: SQL Server authentication is a traditional authentication method that uses a username and password to authenticate to Azure SQL Database\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this example, we will select **Use SQL authentication** as the **Authentication method** for our server, and will create a user and password for login.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/CreateServer.png\" height=\"550\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally click **OK** to create the server, this will redirect you back to the **Create SQL Database** page. The newly created server will now be visible in the servers list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure Compute and Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Once redirected to the **Create SQL Database** page, we can configure the database to the correct size that matches our workload, by clicking **Configure database** under the **Compute + storage** pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/BasicConfiguration.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Azure SQL Database offers different tiers of service for different workloads and performance requirements. One of the options for storage tier is **Basic Compute**, which provides a low-cost option for small databases or those with modest performance needs. Basic Compute is a good option for test and development environments, small-scale applications, and low-traffic websites, like in this case. Select **Basic** from the service tier list and then click **Apply** to apply the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to create the database click **Review + create**, and once the validations have passed click **Create**. The deployment might take a couple of minutes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once deployment is completed click **Go to resource** to access the database overview page.\n",
