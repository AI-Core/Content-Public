    ">In the context of APIs, *routing* refers to the process of defining how an application responds to client requests. Routing acts like a map or guide for how the application should respond when a certain path is accessed or when a certain action is performed. It helps in directing the traffic of requests to the correct code that can process them and return the appropriate response."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning how to achieve effective routing in FastAPI will allow you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce better-organised code, by encapsulating different features of your API in different files\n",
    "- Make professional-looking API apps that are well-structured and easy to debug"

    "When working on a project, the code for each feature of your application will often be partitioned into its own script, rather than having a single large file containing all of the different functions. As a result you might have several Python scripts, each with their own API endpoints defined, all of which need to be available in the main application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In FastAPI, this can be achieved using the `APIRouter` class. `APIRouter` helps you divide your web application into smaller, manageable parts (called *routers*). Each router can have its own set of endpoints, and can be responsible for a specific part of the application. You can think of each instance of `APIRouter` as a \"mini\" API instance. The instances can then be added together in your main file to create the full API.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a case where you are building an API for a book shop, and you have a separate set of endpoints for retrieving the details of books, and another for retrieving authors. While it is possible to achieve this in a single Python file, it would be better to encapsulate your endpoints so that the two different concerns are separated into their own scripts.\n",
