    "# Introduction\n",
    "According to the official website, FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building application programming interfaces (APIs) with Python 3.6+.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of FastAPI relative to other web frameworks include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Easy to use__: The code structure and its encapsulation make it very intuitive to find methods quickly.\n",
    "2. __Fast to code__: FastAPI performs most of the laborious coding tasks. The user simply adds the type of request to be expected and the corresponding response.\n",
    "3. __Employs both OpenAPI and JSON__: The browser displays the data in an organised and readable format, and users can retrieve the data efficiently.\n",
    "4. __Queries are considerably easy to format__: By default, queries have the `str` format; however, if a specific type hint is provided in the function, the input will be cast to that type.\n",
    "5. __Processes requests asynchronously__: Multiple requests can be sent to a FastAPI server while it is processing the previous request. Therefore, new requests can be sent without waiting for the completion of the previous request.\n",
    "6. __Integrates dataclass decorators__: This makes it significantly easy to get an application up and running.\n",
    "7. __Integrates pytest__: APIs can be easily tested before being deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although FastAPI is relatively new, compared to Flask or Django, its adoption is increasing rapidly. We encourage you to explore other libraries for creating applications, such as Tornado and Hug. However, in this lesson, we will focus on FastAPI because of its power and simplicity. We will create APIs with minimal functionality."
