- when building APIs using FastAPI you can declare the type of variables passed to your endpoints using Python's standard type annotations

> the best parts of fastAPI are all based on these type declarations

- by using the typing you get the usual benefits, such as the correct type hints when you're using those variables in your code

_Show doing `name.` and the correct methods showing up as prompts_

- but you also get a bunch of helpful things specifically useful for APIs

- one of those things is that fastAPI automatically performs data conversion

_Add min_price keyword argument to handler_

<!-- TODO typewrite "data conversion" -->

- that means it casts data to the right type if it can
- this is particularly useful as querystring and path parameters are all strings when they are received

- I won't get into the details of passing data to fastAPI right here
- but if I define an argument for this endpoint in the handler function

_Define the function_

- then fastAPI will expect to find that in the request path as a query string, like this

_Show sending an int in the path_

- fastAPI also uses type declarations to perform data validation

<!-- TODO typewrite "data validation" -->

- those types mean that you'll receive an error message if you try to make a request which has invalid data types, that cannot easily be cast into the right type

_Show making a request with invalid types_

- finally, fastAPI uses the type declarations to automatically create documentation
- you can look at the documentation generated by going to the /docs path of your API in a browser

- under the hood it does this is by looking at your code, and turning it into an open standard format known as _openAPI_ which can be specified in YAML or JSON
- at a glance, it looks like this

_Show openAPI JSON example_

- it contains all the different API endpoints specified, their parameters, and more

_Switch to webcam_

- because fastAPI generates a standard format, many documentation generation libraries can interface with it

- so fastAPI provides an alternative documentation generated by a library called redoc

_Show redoc website_

- you can check them out at the /redoc path of your API

_Show http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc_

- it would be easy to extend it to any other documenation library on your own as well

<!-- OUTRO -->

- there's lots more detail in the fastAPI documentation that you should check out, but that's a good start to understanding how the typing and documentation works in fastAPI
