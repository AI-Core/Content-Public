    "*Dockerfiles* are text-based configuration files used to specify how a Docker image should be built. They play a crucial role in creating consistent and reproducible container environment. A Dockerfile contains a series of instructions that define the image's base, environment setup, and application code and dependencies.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Base Image*: This is the starting point for your Docker image, often based on an existing image from a registry like Docker Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Instructions*: Dockerfiles consist of a series of instructions that specify how the image should be configured and what should be included in it. These instructions include actions like installing software, copying files, and configuring environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Commands*: Shell commands are used to execute actions during the image build process. These commands can be used for tasks like installing packages, setting up configurations, or running scripts.\n",

    "- **Comments**: Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored during image build\n",

    "- `FROM`: Specifies the base image to use as a starting point. It defines the foundation of your image, often based on official images from Docker Hub. For example, `FROM ubuntu:20.04` sets the base image as Ubuntu 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ENV`: Sets environment variables within the image, allowing you to configure the runtime environment for your application\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RUN`: Executes commands in the image during the build process. You can use this instruction to install software, update packages, and perform any necessary configuration. For instance, you can use `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-name` to install packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `COPY`: Copies files or directories from the host machine into the image. This is useful for adding application code, configuration files, or assets. For example, `COPY app.py /app/` copies the `app.py` file from your local machine into the `/app` directory in the Docker image.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Security**: Ensure your Dockerfile and image follow security best practices, such as not running as root and using trusted sources for software installation\n",

    "### Understand Cache Management\n",
    "\n",
    "In Docker, some commands can invalidate the cache, necessitating the re-execution of every subsequent step when creating an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following Dockerfile example:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, `python3` will be installed during each docker build regardless of changes in the build context because Docker lacks the capability to determine whether the context for the `COPY` command has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, a more efficient approach is to follow the principle of placing `COPY` statements after setting up the operating system dependencies, especially when the installation of packages like Python is not dependent on the build context. This practice helps optimize the use of cache during image builds."

    "To enhance the efficiency of your Dockerfile, it's advisable to chain multiple commands together using `&&` within a single `RUN` directive whenever possible.\n",

    "## Hands-On: Creating a Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will create a Docker image that runs the `celebrity_births` web scraper. You can download the necessary files for running this scraper [here](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Foundations/DevOps/celebrity_example.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the file, `cd` to that folder, and create a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile`. Inside the Dockerfile, write the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```docker\n",
    "FROM python:3.8-slim-buster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every Docker images start with a base image. This is the foundation upon which your image will be built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventionally, Docker images are built from a pre-built image Docker that can be found on Docker Hub. The pre-built image usually contains some dependencies. A common use case is to use an image with Python installed. You can download and run the pre-built image using the `FROM` clause, as indicated above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, with the first added command, we begin creating the image with the necessary Python dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dockerfiles then consist of a series of instructions that specify how the image should be configure and what should be included in it. These instructions include actions like installing software, copying files, setting environment variables and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we will continue by adding the following line to our Dockerfile:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` docker\n",
    "COPY . . \n",
    "```\n",
    "This will copy everything in the Dockerfile directory (`requirements.txt` and the `scraper` folder) into the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Understanding this step is extremely important. When an image is built, the relevant files are copied into the container, which is analogous to copying them into a different and separate computer. In other words, it is almost as if there is a separate mini computer containing the scraper, with Python installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `.` argument following the `COPY` instruction is the location of the assets **on your machine** that you wish to copy. The second `.` argument following the `COPY` instruction is the location where the assets will be copied to **on the Docker container**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the final step before running the scraper, your Python packages must be installed, e.g. `beautifulsoup` and `requests`. Fortunately, the requirements file was also copied into the image. Thus, the packages can be installed directly using the `RUN` command, followed by the bash command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` docker\n",
    "RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can run the Python script. Note that the `RUN` clause is unsuitable here because `RUN` is executed when the image is built. This is where you perform actions like installing software, setting up configurations, and adding files to the image. It affects the image's content but doesn't dictate what happens when a container is started from the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the `CMD` instruction is sued to specify the default command that should be executed when a container is run from the image. In essence, it determines the container's behaviour when it starts:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` docker\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"scraper/celebrity_scraper.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `CMD` clause can be declared in many ways. In this case, we employ square brackets, and the first item is the executable (`python`), while the rest are the parameters (files). We will discuss in more detail different Dockerfile instructions in a later lesson."
