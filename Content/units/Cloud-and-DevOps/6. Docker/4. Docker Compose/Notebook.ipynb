    "# Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Docker Compose* is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes required for your application in a single YAML file called `docker-compose.yml`. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Docker Compose, you can easily manage and orchestrate multiple Docker containers as a single application, making it simpler to develop, test, and deploy complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about Docker Compose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose simplifies the process of running multiple containers together as a cohesive application. It allows you to specify the relationships and dependencies between containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Declarative Configuration**: Instead of manually starting and configuring containers one by one, you describe your application's architecture, services, and their configurations in a declarative manner in the `docker-compose.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Use**: Docker Compose provides a straightforward command-line interface to manage the entire application stack. You can start, stop, scale, and manage containers with simple commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Development and Testing**: It's particularly useful for development and testing environments, where you can define different services and configurations to mimic your production setup locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portability**: Docker Compose files are portable and can be used across different environments. This ensures that the development and production environments are as close as possible, reducing the \"it works on my machine\" problem."

    "## Why use Docker Compose?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several compelling reasons to use Docker Compose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Development**: Docker Compose streamlines the development process by allowing developers to define the entire application stack, including services, databases, and dependencies, in a single file. This makes it easy to set up and tear down environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Docker Compose ensures that development, staging, and production environments closely mirror each other, reducing inconsistencies and making it easier to catch issues early in the development process\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Docker Compose enables you to scale individual services or containers up or down to accommodate changes in load. This is particularly valuable when deploying to container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Control**: The `docker-compose.yml` file can be version-controlled along with your application's source code, ensuring that the environment configuration is always in sync with the codebase"

    "\n",
    "> By default, `docker-compose up` runs containers in the foreground, displaying logs in the terminal. To run containers in the background, you can use the `-d` flag: `docker-compose up -d`. This way, containers will run in detached mode, and you can continue to use the terminal for other tasks."

    "### Stopping and Removing Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop and remove the containers created by Docker Compose, use the `docker-compose down` command. This command stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It effectively cleans up the resources used by your application.\n",

    "### Viewing Container Status\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the status of containers managed by Docker Compose, you can use the `docker-compose ps` command. It will show you the running state of each service."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Service Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **service** is a definition for a container, specifying how it should be run. Each service in a d `docker-compose.yml` file corresponds to one or more containers. For example, you might have a service for a web application, a database, and a caching server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Service Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Service attributes are used to specify how a container should be run. Some common service attributes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image**: The Docker image to use for the container. You can use official images from Docker Hub or custom images you've created. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  web:\n",
    "    image: nginx:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ports**: Mapping container ports to host ports allows external access to the services. Use the ports attribute to define these mappings. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  web:\n",
    "    image: nginx:latest\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - \"8080:80\"  # Map host port 8080 to container port 80\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment Variables**: You can set environment variables within the container using the environment attribute. This is useful for passing configuration values to the application. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  app:\n",
    "    image: my-app:latest\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      DATABASE_URL: \"mysql://username:password@db-host/db-name\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volumes**: Volumes are used for data persistence and sharing data between containers or between the host and container. You can define volumes using the volumes attribute. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  db:\n",
    "    image: mysql:latest\n",
    "    volumes:\n",
    "      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql\n",
    "volumes:\n",
    "  mysql-data:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a named volume named `mysql-data` is created. It's mounted into the `/var/lib/mysql` directory of the `db` container, ensuring that the database data persists even if the container is stopped or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Command**: The command attribute allows you to specify the command to run when starting the container. This can be useful for overriding the default command defined in the Docker image. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  worker:\n",
    "    image: my-worker:latest\n",
    "    command: ./start-worker.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linking Services\n",
    "\n",
    "> Docker Compose allows you to define relationships and dependencies between services. This is done using the `depends_on` attribute to specify which services a given service depends on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your web application depends on a database service, you can define it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  web:\n",
    "    image: my-web-app:latest\n",
    "    depends_on:\n",
    "      - db\n",
    "  db:\n",
    "    image: mysql:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `web` service depends on the `db` service. When you start the application with `docker-compose up`, Docker Compose ensures that the `db` service is started before the `web`service."

    "## Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Docker Compose, environment variables play a crucial role in configuring services and containers within your application. They allow you to customize container behavior, pass configuration values, and manage the runtime environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can define environment variables for a service in your `docker-compose.yml` file under the `environment` key within the service definition. For example, consider a web service that requires a database connection URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "version: '3'\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  web:\n",
    "    image: my-web-app:latest\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      DATABASE_URL: \"mysql://username:password@db-host/db-name\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've defined environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml`, those variables are accessible within the containerized application.\n",
    "\n",
    "ou can set default values for environment variables in your Docker Compose file to provide sensible defaults when an environment variable is not explicitly set.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  app:\n",
    "    image: my-app:latest\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      PORT: \"3000\" # Default port if not provided\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose can also read environment variables from an external `.env` file. By default, it looks for a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file. This approach is useful for keeping sensitive or environment-specific variables separate from your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "# .env file\n",
    "DATABASE_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can override environment variables defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file by specifying them in your shell environment or in an external `.env` file."

    "## Best Practices and Tips \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose is a versatile tool, and following best practices can help you make the most of it while ensuring smooth development and deployment workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Practices for Writing `docker-compose.yml` Files\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep It Simple**: Start with simple and straightforward `docker-compose.yml` files. As your project grows, you can add complexity incrementally. Avoid overly complex configurations at the outset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Service Names**: Refer to other services within your `docker-compose.yml` file by their service names rather than hardcoding IP addresses or hostnames. This promotes portability and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separate Configuration**: Keep configuration settings, including environment variables and secrets, outside of the Compose file whenever possible. Use external environment files or secret management tools to store sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versioning**: Specify the Docker Compose version at the top of your Compose file (e.g., version: '3'). Keep your Compose files up to date with the latest version to take advantage of new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comments and Documentation**: Add comments to your Compose file to explain the purpose of services and any non-obvious configurations. Good documentation helps other team members understand your setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Container Image Size**: Use minimal and optimized base images for your containers. Smaller images reduce deployment times and save storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layer Caching**: Take advantage of Docker's image layer caching. Place frequently changing dependencies later in your Dockerfile to maximize cache reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volume Mounts**: Be cautious with excessive use of volume mounts, as they can impact performance. Only mount volumes that are necessary for data persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging and Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logs**: Use `docker-compose logs` to view the logs of your running services. The `-f` flag allows you to follow the logs in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inspect Containers**: Use `docker-compose ps` to list running containers and their status. You can then use `docker-compose exec` to execute commands within a specific container for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure that there are no port conflicts between services in your Compose file. Use unique host and container ports when mapping ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment Variables**: Double-check environment variable values. Incorrect or missing values can cause application failures."
