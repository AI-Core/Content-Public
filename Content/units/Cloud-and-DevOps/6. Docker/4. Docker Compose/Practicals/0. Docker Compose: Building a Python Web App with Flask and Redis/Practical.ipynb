    "In this practical, you will build a simple Python web application. Flask is the framework that will be used to create the web application, and Redis is an in-memory data store that will be employed to maintain a hit counter for the application. All the necessary components will be provided to you through Docker containers, so you don't need to worry about not having previous experience using these technologies.\n",

    "## Step 1: Define the Application Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a project directory called `compose-test`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside this directory, create a Python script file named `app.py`. Copy the contents of this [file](https://cdn.theaicore.com/content/lessons/fc11754a-1137-46ba-818f-0e03b76c1c26/practicals/40a51190-e822-450b-9316-c8df12991888/app.py) in the script.\n",
