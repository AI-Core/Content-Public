    "Occasionally, programmers encounter the issue of compatibility between the application being run and the OS or the installed packages.\n",
    "The solution to this issue is [Docker](https://www.docker.com), a containerization platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable *containers*. These containers can run consistently across various environments, from a developer's laptop to a production server. \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Containerization* is the practice of packaging an application along with its required dependencies, libraries, and runtime into a single container. This ensures that applications run consistently, regardless of the underlying system, and helps eliminate compatibility issues."

    "## Docker Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is vital in the world of software development for many reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Docker provides a consistent environment for applications, ensuring that what runs on a developer's machine will run the same way in production. This consistency reduces the \"it works on my machine\" problem, which is a common source of frustration in development teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Docker containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, isolating them from the host system and other containers. This isolation promotes security and prevents conflicts between applications and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portability**: Docker containers are highly portable. You can create a container on one machine and run it on any other machine with Docker installed, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This portability simplifies the deployment process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Docker containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel, which makes them efficient in terms of resource utilization. This efficiency allows you to run more containers on the same hardware, optimizing resource allocation."

    "## Key Docker Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is composed of several key components, each with its unique role in the containerisation process. These components work together seamlessly to enable the creation, management, and deployment of containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Docker Images\n",
    "\n",
    "*Docker images* are at the heart of containerization, serving as the building blocks of containers. They are like blueprint templates for container. An image contains everything needed to run an application including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The application's code and files\n",
    "- Libraries and dependencies required for the application\n",
    "- The operating system or a minimal OS subset\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key aspects to understand about Docker images are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. To modify an image, you create a new image based on an existing one.\n",
    "- Images are typically based on a specific Linux distribution or a parent image. This parent image forms the foundation upon which your application and its dependencies are layered.\n",
    "- Docker images are stored in a layered format, where each layer represents a set of changes or instructions. These layers can be shared and reused, promoting efficiency and reducing storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn how to create Docker images in a future lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Docker Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker containers are runnable instances created from Docker images. They encapsulate an application and its runtime environment, ensuring that it runs consistently across different systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "A container is similar to a virtual machine (VM), but while a VM virtualises the hardware, a container only virtualises the OS. Note that Docker does not make a copy of the OS you want to work with, rather it provides the necessary tools for working with that specific OS. For example, if an application runs the latest Ubuntu version, Docker will not install the latest Ubuntu version each time the application runs. Instead, it obtains the necessary tools to run that version without installing the entire OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key aspects about Docker containers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, allowing multiple applications to run independently without interfering with one another\n",
    "- Containers can be easily started, stopped, and deleted, providing flexibility and scalability to your applications\n",
    "- The runtime environment inside a container is defined by the image from which it was created, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Docker Registries\n",
    "\n",
    "*Docker registries* are repositories that store and distribute Docker images. They are essentials for sharing and collaborating on containerized applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Public registries like *Docker Hub* host a vast collection of pre-built Docker images that you can use as a starting point for your projects. On the other hand, private registries enable organizations to store and manage their custom images securely, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first step in the learning process, go to the [Docker Hub website](https://hub.docker.com), and create an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/Docker_Hub.png width=800 height=400> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this lesson, we will revisit DockerHub, but we will also extensively cover Docker registries generally in another lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Docker Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "*Docker volumes* are used for managing data persistence between containers and the host system. They play a crucial role in scenarios where you need to preserve data, such as databases or application state. Here's what you should know about Docker volumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Volumes are separate from container file systems, allowing data to persist even if the container is removed\n",
    "- They can be mounted into containers, enabling data sharing and synchronization between containers and the host\n",
    "- Volumes are particularly valuable for database containers, where data durability and persistence are critical\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover Docker volumes in more detail in another lesson."

    "## Setting up Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important! Before proceeding, we recommended that you use VSCode on your local machine since the files you'll run require the Docker engine to containerize applications locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Docker on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux users, installing Docker involves setting up the Docker engine, which forms the core of Docker technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install it visit the official Docker documentation for Linux installation and follow the proposed [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/). There, you will find the steps for installing Docker depending on your distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Ubuntu, you can simply visit this [website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). Please adhere to the instructions for installing the Docker engine `using the repository`.\n",

    "### Installing Docker on Windows Home Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the Windows Home edition is highly unsuitable for installing any application that requires kernel access. So, if you are using Windows Home edition, you'll need to enable Hyper-V and use the Hyper-V Enable to grant access to the kernel. You can download the Hyper-V Enabler [here](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Foundations/DevOps/Hyper-V-Enabler.bat).\n",
    "\n",

    "- Windows hypervisor platform\n",
    "- Windows subsystem for Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/Docker_Home_Edition.png width=400> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also need to install the latest version of WSL. Install it using the following [file](https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Foundations/DevOps/wsl_update_x64.msi).\n",
    "\n",
    "After enabling these features and installing WSL, follow the instructions provided in the **Installing Docker on macOS and Windows (Non-Home Edition)** section above to complete the Docker Desktop installation.\n",

    "## Running Your First Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've installed Docker and learned about its core concepts, it's time to get hands-on experience by running your first Docker container. This section will walk you through the process step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pulling a Docker Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can run a container, you need an image. Docker images are available from Docker Hub, a public repository of container images. To pull an image, open your terminal or command prompt and use the `docker pull` command followed by the image name. In this example, we'll use the official Nginx image: `docker pull nginx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command downloads the Nginx image from Docker Hub to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Running a Container\n",
    "\n",
    "With the image downloaded, you can now run a container. Use the `docker run` command to start a container based on the image you pulled. For instance, to start an Nginx web server container, you can run: `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `docker run`: The command to start a container\n",
    "- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode, which means it runs in the background\n",
    "- `-p 80:80`: Maps port 80 of your host to port 80 in the container, allowing you to access the web server from your host machine\n",
    "- `nginx`: The name of the image to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Accessing the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your container is running, you can access it using a web browser or a command-line tool like `curl`. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost (or http://127.0.0.1), and you should see the default Nginx welcome page.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/Nginx.png width=800 height=400> </p>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll receive the HTML content of the Nginx welcome page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Managing the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "To see a list of running containers, you can use the `docker ps` command. This will display information about your running Nginx container, including its container ID, status, ports, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Stopping and Removing the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're finished with a container, you can stop it using `docker stop` followed by the container ID or name. For example: `docker stop <container_id_or_name>`.\n",
