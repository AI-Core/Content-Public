    "## Release Pipelines and CI/CD\n",
    "\n",
    "In a DevOps workflow, Continuous Integration is the first step in the software delivery pipeline. It focuses on automating the building, testing, and integration of code as soon as changes are committed to version control. We have seen in the previous lesson that **Azure DevOps Build Pipelines** are a core element of CI pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Deployment extends the CI process by automating the deployment of code to different environments. The CD pipeline takes over when CI confirms that the code is ready for production. Release Pipelines are the orchestrators of the deployment process. They coordinate the movement of code through various stages, aligning with the principles of CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of automating the deployment process include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: When deployments are automated, you can rely on consistent processes and outcomes. Human error is minimized, and each deployment adheres to a predefined set of steps, resulting in uniform releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed**: Automation accelerates the delivery of software updates. It means your applications can reach your end-users faster, keeping them engaged with the latest features and bug fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Automation doesn't just speed up the process; it makes it more reliable. Your deployment process becomes predictable, reducing the risk of unexpected failures and minimizing downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rollback Capability**: Automated deployment pipelines come with the safety net of rollback capabilities. If an issue arises during deployment, you can quickly revert to a previous, stable version, ensuring your users aren't affected."

    "## Azure DevOps Artifacts in Release Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "*Artifacts* serve as building blocks for deploying your application to different environments. They play a pivotal role in the overall CI/CD process, acting as the intermediary between the build and deployment phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "*Build artifacts* are the most common type of artifacts used in release pipelines. These are the outcomes of the build process, generated when the code is compiled, tested, and packaged. Examples of build artifacts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Docker Images**: If you're containerizing your application, a Docker image is a typical build artifact. It contains your application and its dependencies, providing a consistent and isolated environment for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compiled Code**: For applications that are not containerized, compiled code or binaries are common build artifacts. These are the executable files or libraries that can be deployed to target environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Installation Packages**: In scenarios where your application needs to be installed on a server, build artifacts may include installation packages that simplify the deployment process\n",
    "\n",
    "In your release pipeline, you'll specify which build artifacts to use for deployment. These artifacts should be well-tested and ready for promotion to various stages, ensuring consistency and reliability in the deployment process. \n",
    "\n",
    "While they are powerful components of Azure DevOps, they are not mandatory to use in your Build/Release Pipelines. For example, you might have a Build Pipeline that builds a Docker image and then pushes it to Docker Hub. In this case, you won't need to create a build artifact, as the Release Pipeline can directly pull the image from Docker Hub instead, thus relying on an external artifact, which we will cover in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure DevOps provides package feeds to manage and distribute various types of packages, including libraries, frameworks, and modules. Package feeds ensure that dependencies and components your application relies on are readily available during deployment. By referencing these feeds, your release pipeline can retrieve and include the necessary packages in the deployment process. This reduces the risk of compatibility issues and ensures that the correct versions are deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, your application may rely on external sources or services that are not part of your Azure DevOps environment. External artifacts are references to these sources and are critical for managing deployments that involve external dependencies. Examples of external artifacts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Container Registries**: If your application relies on container images hosted in external container registries (e.g., Docker Hub), you would set up references to these external container repositories in your release pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GitHub Repositories**: For source code, libraries, or other resources hosted on GitHub, you can configure references to GitHub repositories in your release pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "By specifying these external artifacts in your release pipeline, you ensure that the necessary external resources are accessible and integrated into your deployment process, maintaining a seamless and efficient workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In addition to artifacts, Release Pipelines include all the other components that Build Pipelines offer, ensuring a comprehensive approach to your CI/CD pipeline."

We will build upon the example from the Build Pipeline lesson, so make sure to follow along that hands-on before.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Remember, as mentioned in the previous lesson you won't have the necessary computer power access to run pipelines right now, but this will be provided to you when you reach the specialization project, where you will have to set up your own Azure DevOps Pipeline. So make sure to understand the provided example, but you don't need to replicate this example now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Navigate to Azure DevOps and Access your Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in with your Azure DevOps accounts credentials. After signing in, you'll be taken to the Azure DevOps dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To initiate the creation of a Release Pipeline, select the project where you have previously set up the Build Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on guide, we will set up a Release Pipeline that deploys our example application to an AKS cluster. The repository of the application used here already contains the necessary Kubernetes deployment manifest, but not the `secrets.yaml` necessary to define the application environment variables. This file was uploaded to `.gitignore` because it contains sensitive information, and therefore Azure DevOps won't have access to the information stored there. Instead, we will add additional steps to this pipeline to automatically generate the environment variables needed for the Kubernetes manifest, and then apply these to the AKS cluster to deploy the sample application.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Step 2: Create Pipeline Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "If the containerised application you want to deploy to AKS has sensitive information that is normally passed onto the Docker container during the `docker run` command as environment variables, or using a `secrets.yaml` for Kubernetes deployments, you will need to modify the pipeline configuration to include these environment variables. To achieve this you need to:\n",
    "- Store your environment variables in Azure DevOps as pipeline variables\n",
    "- Update the pipeline YAML to pass these environment variables to the Kubernetes deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "To store environment variables in an Azure DevOps pipeline:\n",
    "- Go to your Azure DevOps project, and navigate **Pipelines**, and click on **Library**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/Library.png width=400 height=250> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on the **+ Variable group** button to create a new variable group. Name your variable group (e.g., flask-app-secrets) and add new variables for the environment variables that your Docker container requires. For example, if your Docker container has database authentication environment variables, add these here.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Make sure to mark each variable as a secret if they contain sensitive information, like in the case of database authentication details. To do so, click on the lock simple on the right-hand side of the value field for that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/LibrarySecrets.png width=700 height=350> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Update Pipeline YAML with Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow an Azure DevOps pipeline to access and utilise variables effectively, it's crucial to configure and manage these variables correctly within your pipeline definition. Variables in Azure DevOps pipelines can store values that are essential for various stages of your CI/CD processes, such as Docker builds, Kubernetes deployments, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the variables defined in the variable groups, you need to edit the pipeline YAML file to use the `variables` section. This section is used to reference variable groups that you have created previously through Azure DevOps. For example, if you have defined a variable group named `flask-app-secrets`, this is how you would edit the YAML pipeline:\n",

    "### Step 4: Create and Apply Kubernetes Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and apply Kubernetes secrets from pipeline variables, you will use the Azure CLI task in your Azure DevOps pipeline. This step ensures that sensitive information is securely managed and applied to your Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will use this command to install the Azure CLI: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az aks install-cli\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command ensures that `kubectl` is installed on the build agent, allowing it to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, just as we did locally we can use the `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>` to retrieve the credentials needed to access your AKS cluster and configure `kubectl` to use these credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the secrets, we will a command similar to the one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "kubectl create secret generic <k8s-secret-name> \\\n",
    "  --from-literal=<secret-name>=$(<secret-name-in-variable-group) \n",
    "  --dry-run=client -o yaml > k8s-secret.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates a Kubernetes secret named `<k8s-secret-name>` using the values provided by the pipeline variables. The `--dry-run=client` flag ensures that the secret is generated in YAML format without actually applying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to apply the secrets, we will use the `kubectl apply -f k8s-secret.yaml` command, to apply the generated file to your AKS cluster, creating or updating the Kubernetes secret with the provided data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all the steps above together, the pipeline task would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "- task: AzureCLI@2\n",
