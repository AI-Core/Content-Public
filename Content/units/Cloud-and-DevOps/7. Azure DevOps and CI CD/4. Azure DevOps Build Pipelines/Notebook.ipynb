    "## Components of Build Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "A Build Pipeline consists of multiple components that work together to automate the build and testing process. Understanding these components is crucial for effective pipeline configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline Configuration**: This is the heart of your Build Pipeline. It includes the `YAML` file that defines the stages, steps, and triggers for your pipeline. It acts as a blueprint for your build and provides the necessary instructions to Azure DevOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build Agents**: Build agents are the virtual machines or containers where your pipeline's tasks are executed. Azure DevOps provides a pool of build agents with different capabilities. You can specify the agent pool and job demands in your pipeline configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jobs**: *Jobs* are the individual units of work. Each job can run on a separate build agent, making it possible to parallelize tasks for faster execution. Jobs can contain multiple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tasks**: *Tasks* are the smallest units of work within a job. They represent specific actions, such as compiling code, running tests, or publishing artifacts. Azure DevOps provides a wide range of built-in tasks, and you can create custom tasks when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Triggers**: Triggers define the conditions that cause the pipeline to run. Common triggers include code commits to the repository, pull requests, scheduled times, and manual triggers. Configuring the right triggers is essential for automating the build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables**: Variables allow you to store and manage values that can be used throughout the pipeline. You can use predefined system variables or create custom ones to parameterize your pipeline and make it more dynamic."

    "\n",
    "> When establishing an Azure DevOps account integrated with GitHub, it's important to note that by default, you won't have access to any compute resources. This means that you won't be able to execute jobs on the default compute pool. To gain the capability to run jobs and utilize compute resources, you will need to purchase compute time. It's worth noting that this isn't necessary for the current pathway; instead, ensure that you thoroughly review and comprehend the provided examples. When you reach the specialization project, you will be provided with an Azure DevOps account with computing power access.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already on the specialization project and have configured your Azure DevOps organization, follow these steps to purchase compute time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by accessing the homepage of your Azure DevOps Organization. You should see a page that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/AzureDevOpsOrganization.png width=800 height=450> </p>\n",

    "### Step 4: Configure the Build Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuring your Azure DevOps Build Pipeline is a critical step in setting up a robust CI/CD workflow. During the initial pipeline configuration, you'll have access to various templates and configurations tailored to different technology stacks and CI/CD scenarios. Here's an overview of some of these options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Docker Build a Docker Image**: Use this template when your application is containerized using Docker. It configures the pipeline to build a Docker image based on your Dockerfile and optionally push it to a container registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Docker Build and Push to Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: This template is ideal when you want to build a Docker image and securely push it to an Azure Container Registry (ACR). It streamlines the process of storing your Docker images in Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: If you're deploying containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), this template simplifies the setup. It enables you to deploy your Docker containers to an AKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Starter Pipeline**: This is a basic starting point for creating custom pipelines. It provides a simple template that you can customize according to your project's requirements. You can define build steps, triggers, and other pipeline settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML Files**: If you already have an Azure Pipelines `YAML` file (`azure-pipelines.yml`) in your repository, you can select this option. It allows you to use your existing `YAML` configuration as the basis of your pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Language-Specific Templates**: Azure DevOps offers templates tailored to specific programming languages such as .NET, Node.js, Python, and others. These templates come pre-configured with settings and build steps optimized for the selected language stack, making it easier to set up CI/CD for your specific technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "> During the initial pipeline configure for our example, we will choose the **Starter Pipeline** template. This will create a basic `azure-pipelines.yml` example for you. This example serves as a starting point and can be customized according to your project's specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/StarterPipeline.png width=800 height=350> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the components of the starter pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trigger**: This section defines when the pipeline should run. In this example, it is set to trigger on the `main` branch. This means that whenever there is a code commit or a push to the `main` branch, the pipeline will automatically start.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pool**: The `pool` section specifies the virtual machine or container environment where the pipeline's tasks will run. In this case, it's set to use an Ubuntu-based image (`vmImage: ubuntu-latest`). The choice of the image depends on the requirements of your project, and you can select different images based on your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steps**: The `steps` section contains the tasks that will be executed as part of the pipeline. Each task is defined within a `- script:` block. In this example, there are two simple script tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The first task simply prints `\"Hello, world!\"` to the console\n",
    "  - The second task is a multi-line script that provides guidance on how to add other tasks for building, testing, and deploying your project. The `displayName` field is used to give a friendly name to each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will complete the pipeline configuration by saving it without making any changes to the template. You can save this example pipeline and familiarize yourself with the Azure DevOps pipeline execution process. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Remember, as mentioned above you won't have the necessary computer power access to run pipelines right now, but this will be provided to you when you reach the specialization project, where you will have to set up your own Azure DevOps Pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure DevOps may prompt you to provide additional information before saving. For example, it may ask you to specify a commit message, a branch, or other related details. When prompted to specify the branch to which you want to commit your pipeline configuration, you can select the `main` branch. The `main` branch is a common choice for storing pipeline configurations and associated code. After specifying the branch and adding a commit message, proceed with the save action.\n",
    "\n",
