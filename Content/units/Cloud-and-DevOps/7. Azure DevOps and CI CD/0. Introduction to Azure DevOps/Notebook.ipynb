    "4. **Subscription ID and Name**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Subscription ID**: This is a unique identifier for your Azure subscription.\n",
    "      - Log in to the Azure portal. Search for **Subscriptions** in the Homepage search bar\n",
    "      - This should display a list of the active subscriptions in your Azure account and their respective subscription ID <br><br>\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - **Subscription Name**: The subscription name is simply the name of your Azure subscription. It's typically displayed next to the Subscription ID in the Azure portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Service Principal Configuration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Service Principal ID**: This is the ID of the Azure AD application (service principal) that will authenticate to AKS. A **service principal** is an identity that can be used for automated access to Azure resources. If you followed along the Terraform lessons you should already have this information available, the Service Principal ID is simply the `client_id`/`appID` of the `provider \"azurerm\"` block in any Terraform configuration that connects to your Azure account.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Service principal key**: When you create a service principal it will generate a client secret (authentication key). This corresponds to the `client_secret`/`password` in the `provider \"azurerm\"` block in any Terraform configuration that connects to your Azure account.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Tenant ID**: Specifies the Azure AD tenant ID. This corresponds to the `tenant_id`/`tenant` in the `provider \"azurerm\"` block in any Terraform configuration that connects to your Azure account.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/ServiceConnectionSetUp.png width=350 height=550> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test Connection**: Before saving, test the connection to ensure that it can successfully authenticate and interact with the AKS cluster. It should be able to retrieve cluster information.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Save and Use**: Once configured and tested, save the service connection. It is now ready for use in your pipelines and automation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/ServiceConnections.png width=800 height=400> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the AKS service connection is set up you should see it in your Service connection list, and you can use it in your Azure DevOps pipelines and automation tasks to interact with the AKS cluster. For example, you can use it to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploy containerized applications to the AKS cluster\n",
    "- Scale and manage the AKS cluster\n",
    "- Execute `kubectl` commands to interact with Kubernetes resources\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this example and considering the security best practices, you can create and manage Azure service connections for AKS and other Azure resources securely and efficiently, enabling seamless integration with your DevOps processes."
