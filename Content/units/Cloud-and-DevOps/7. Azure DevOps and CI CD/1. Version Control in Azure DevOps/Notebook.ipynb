    "## git Fundamentals Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "git is a widely used distributed version control system known for its speed, flexibility, and powerful branching capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a quick recap on the key git concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repositories**: A git repository is a container for your project's codebase and its complete history\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commits**: Commits are snapshots of the code at a specific point in time. Each commit is associated with a unique identifier and contains changes made to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branches**: Branches are separate lines of development. They allow for parallel work on different features or bug fixes. The default branch is called `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remotes**: Remotes are references to repositories hosted on remote servers. They facilitate collaboration by enabling users to fetch and push changes to shared repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "git is an integral part of modern software development workflows due to its capabilities in version control, branching, and collaboration. It enables practices like Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), where changes are automatically tested and deployed to production environments. git also supports *Gitflow* and feature branching strategies, which streamline feature development and release processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll explore how to leverage git within Azure DevOps for efficient version control and team collaboration."

    "## git Repositories in Azure DevOps\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure DevOps offers robust git repository hosting by providing a cloud-based platform, where teams can create, manage, and collaborate on git repositories. Azure DevOps is the preferred choice in many scenarios over other platforms such as GitHub because of the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated DevOps Ecosystem**: Azure DevOps offers an all-in-one solution for git hosting, project management, CI/CD, testing, and more. Unlike GitHub, where you might need to integrate multiple third-party tools, Azure DevOps provides a tightly integrated ecosystem. This streamlines your DevOps workflow, ensuring seamless transitions from code development to deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access to Azure Services**: Azure DevOps is part of the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. This integration provides direct access to a wide range of Azure services, including cloud resources, machine learning, and more. You can easily link your git-hosted code to Azure resources, making it convenient for building and deploying cloud-native applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security and Permissions**: Azure DevOps offers robust access control and permission management. You can finely tune permissions for individuals or teams, ensuring that only authorized users have access to your repositories. While GitHub also provides security features, Azure DevOps may be preferred for organizations with stringent security requirements or complex access control needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in CI/CD Pipelines**: Azure DevOps includes built-in CI/CD pipelines with extensive automation capabilities. You can easily set up automated testing, building, and deployment processes directly from your git repositories. While GitHub provides Actions for CI/CD, Azure DevOps might be preferred for organizations seeking a fully integrated and customizable CI/CD solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure Boards Integration**: Azure DevOps seamlessly integrates with Azure Boards, offering comprehensive project management capabilities. This integration allows you to link code changes to work items, ensuring traceability between code and project tasks. GitHub offers project management features, but Azure DevOps provides a more extensive set of tools for managing projects and tracking progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Azure DevOps provides a powerful and well-integrated platform for hosting git repositories. Beyond hosting, it offers numerous advantages over other platforms like GitHub, particularly in terms of its tightly integrated DevOps ecosystem, access to Azure services, security features, and scalability.

    "### Repository Settings and Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "In Azure DevOps, repository settings include a range of configurations that help define how your git repository is managed, accessed, and protected. These settings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "*Access control settings* determine who can access the repository, create branches, make changes, and perform administrative tasks. Access control ensures that the right individuals or teams have the appropriate level of access to your codebase. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should already have a repository provisioned from the previous lesson, if you haven't created one already make sure to go back and follow the instructions. To configure access control you have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to your Azure DevOps project and from under **Project settings** --> **Repositories** select the repository you have created. This will open the repository homepage which should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/RepoHomepage.png width=800 height=450> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the **Security** tab to set access permissions. Here, you can specify who can read, contribute, or manage the repository. You should see a similar page:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/RepoAccessControl.png width=650 height=500> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key information that can be seen on this page includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Azure DevOps Groups**: Azure DevOps provides the concept of groups to simplify permission management. Groups allow you to assign permissions to multiple users or teams collectively, rather than setting permissions individually for each user. Common groups include Contributors, Readers, and Administrators. We have covered these in detail in the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Users**: Users are individual team members or collaborators who have access to your Azure DevOps project. Each user can belong to one or more groups, and you can grant specific permissions to them directly if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Permissions**: A wide range of permissions that can be assigned to groups or users are present in this page. For example the **Contribute** permission, allows users with this permission to contribute to the repository, including creating branches, committing code changes and pushing code. Users with the **Manage Permissions** set can manage repository permissions for other users or groups. Check out [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/set-git-repository-permissions?view=azure-devops) for a comprehensive overview of all the different permissions that can be attached to users and groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State**: Permissions can be configured at different levels, such as project-level, repository-level, or branch-level, and they can be set to one of three states:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Not Set**: The permission is not explicitly defined at that level. In such cases, Azure DevOps inherits the permission from a higher-level scope. For example, if a user does not have a specific permission explicitly set at the repository level, it will inherit the permission from the project-level settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Allow**: When a permission is set to **Allow**, it grants the user or group the right to perform the specified action. For instance, if you set the **Contribute** permission to **Allow** for a user, they will have the ability to contribute to the codebase, create branches, push code changes, and perform other actions associated with that permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Deny**: Setting a permission to **Deny** explicitly blocks the user or group from performing the specified action, even if they would inherit an **Allow** permission from a higher-level scope. Denying a permission takes precedence over any **Allow** permissions. For instance, if you deny the **Create branch** permission, even if a user has an **Allow** permission at a higher level, they won't be able to create branches in that specific repository or branch.\n"

    "#### Branch Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Branch policies help enforce rules and quality checks on code changes. These policies can include requirements for code reviews, status checks, and automatic testing before code can be merged into specific branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure branch policies follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Within your repository, navigate to **Branches**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/InitializeMain.png width=900 height=450> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you haven't created a `main` branch yet, you can do so by clicking on **Initialize** button at the bottom of the page. You'll have the option to add a `README` file and/or a `.gitignore` file. These files provide essential documentation and specify which files should be excluded from version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once the `main` branch is created, choose the branch for which you want to set policies (e.g., the `main` branch) but don't click on this branch. Click on the **...** (More options) next to the branch name, and select **Branch policies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/BranchPolicies.png width=750 height=350> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will be redirected to a page, where you can configure policies like requiring code reviews, build validation, or status checks before allowing code merges\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of branch policies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Review Policy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This policy requires that all code changes made to the branch undergo a code review before they can be merged. Code reviews involve peer review, ensuring that code quality and best practices are maintained.\n",
    "  - You can specify the number of reviewers required and designate specific individuals or teams as reviewers <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build Validation Policy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Build validation policies ensure that code changes don't break the build. Before code is merged, it must pass a build process, including compilation and testing.\n",
    "  - You can define the build pipeline or job that should be run as part of the validation process. The policy prevents merging if the build fails.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Status Check Policy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Status checks are custom checks that assess specific criteria, such as automated tests, code analysis, or integration with external systems. Code can only be merged if all specified status checks pass.\n",
    "  - You can configure various status checks based on your project's needs and tools <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comment Resolution Policy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This policy ensures that all comments and discussions in pull requests are addressed before merging. It helps in maintaining a clear and resolved conversation around code changes. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Policies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - You can define custom policies using policies based on specific criteria or conditions relevant to your project. This flexibility enables you to enforce custom quality checks and workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "By configuring these branch policies, you can establish a robust quality control process for your codebase. Each policy contributes to code quality, security, and reliability, ensuring that code changes meet your project's standards before they are merged into specific branches."

    "#### Importance of Setting Up Appropriate Permissions and Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing the right permissions and policies within your git repository is critical for maintaining code quality and ensuring security. Here's why it's crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Quality**: Permissions and policies related to code reviews, branch policies, and coding standards contribute to code quality. They help catch issues early in the development process, ensure consistent coding practices, and prevent the introduction of low-quality or buggy code into your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Depending on your industry or project requirements, there may be compliance standards that you need to meet. By configuring appropriate policies, you can ensure that your codebase complies with these standards, avoiding potential legal and regulatory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Collaboration**: Access control settings and collaboration policies ensure that team members work cohesively. They prevent unauthorized changes and provide a structured process for code contributions, reviews, and discussions.\n",

    "## git Branching Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching strategies are the core of efficient code management, enabling teams to work cohesively on projects, manage releases, and maintain code quality. Let's introduce some key branching strategies and provide insight into when and why you should employ each one:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Branching**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *Feature branching* involves creating dedicated branches for individual features or tasks. Developers work independently on these branches, making changes and adding new features. Once a feature is completed and thoroughly tested, it is merged back into the main or development branch.\n",
    "  - Feature branching is ideal when you want to isolate work on specific features, making it easier to track progress, conduct code reviews, and maintain a clean and organized codebase <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Release Branching**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *Release branching* centers around the creation of a distinct branch for each software release. This branch is used to stabilize the code, address last-minute issues, and perform release-specific testing. Once the release is ready, it is merged into the production branch.\n",
    "  - Employ release branching when you need to meticulously prepare and stabilize a release while allowing ongoing development to continue on new features. This strategy ensures that critical bug fixes and updates do not interfere with ongoing feature development.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gitflow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Gitflow is a comprehensive branching model that defines a structured approach to feature development, release management, and hot fixes. It establishes branches like feature, develop, release, and hotfix branches, each with a specific role in the development process.\n",
    "  - Gitflow is well-suited for projects with complex release cycles, strict version management, and a need for clear separation of responsibilities between different branches. It provides a disciplined framework for managing code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Branching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of a branching strategy should be influenced by several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project Size**: For smaller projects, a simpler branching strategy like feature branching may suffice. Larger projects with multiple contributors may benefit from more structured models like Gitflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Release Frequency**: If your project has frequent releases, release branching becomes essential to ensure smooth release management\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Collaboration**: Consider how your team collaborates. Feature branching supports isolated work, while Gitflow offers a more organized approach for larger teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to combine branching strategies to suit your project's unique needs. For instance, you might use feature branching for ongoing development and introduce release branching when preparing for a significant release."

    "\n",
    "#### Develop Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "- The develop branch acts as a central integration branch for ongoing development work. It represents the latest state of the codebase with all completed features.\n",
    "- Feature branches are merged into the develop branch, allowing developers to collaborate on new features and improvements. This branch is continuously integrated and tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature branches are created for individual features or tasks. They branch off from the develop branch and are used for developing and testing new functionality. \n",
    "- Developers create feature branches from the develop branch to work on specific features or enhancements\n",
    "- When a feature is complete and passes testing, it is merged back into the develop branch\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing Releases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Release branches are created from the develop branch when a stable release is being prepared\n",
    "- The release branch allows for final testing, bug fixing, and any necessary adjustments before the release is considered production-ready\n",
    "- Once the release is stable and approved, it is tagged and merged into both the main and develop branches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Hot fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hotfix branches are created from the master branch to address critical issues in the production code\n",

    "Developers can respond to comments left by reviewers. If a comment requires clarification or further discussion, developers can reply to it directly within the comment thread. This threaded discussion format allows for clear and organized communication about specific code issues. Based on feedback received in comments, developers can make revisions to their code directly in the branch associated with the pull request. After making changes, developers can push the updates to the pull request for further review.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the reviewing process for a pull request is completed, it enters a phase where the reviewers, or the author of the code changes, take specific actions to indicate their assessment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers have the option to use the **Approve** button on the PR page when they are satisfied with the code changes and consider them ready for merging into the target branch. It signals their approval of the proposed changes. **Approve with Suggestions** can be used when reviewers agree with the changes but wish to suggest improvements or offer more feedback. This option maintains a collaborative tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where reviewers believe further work or revisions are needed before approval, they may select the **Wait for Author** option. This signals to the author that additional changes are expected. This option allows reviewers to hold off on approval until the necessary adjustments are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Reject** option is used when reviewers believe that the code changes are not suitable for merging due to significant issues or deviations from coding standards.
