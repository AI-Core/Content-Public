    "## Managed Identity in Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Managed Identity** is a crucial security feature in Azure designed to simplify the authentication and authorization processes for applications and services. It eliminates the need for developers to manually manage credentials. Instead, it provides an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra ID authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of Managed Identity is to provide a secure identity for applications, allowing them to connect to resources without the need for explicit credentials. It acts as a seamless and secure way for applications to obtain Microsoft Entra ID tokens, enabling secure communication without manual credential management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managed Identity is beneficial in scenarios such as deploying applications on Azure VMs, hosting web applications on Azure App Service, running containerized workloads on AKS, or using serverless architectures like Azure Functions. It simplifies authentication processes, enhances security, and eliminates the need for developers to manage explicit credentials. Additionally, it is particularly advantageous when applications need to securely retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managed Identity Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure provides two types of managed identities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System-assigned Managed Identity**: When enabling a system-assigned managed identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Created directly on specific Azure resources (e.g., Virtual Machines or Azure App Service). Only the specified resource can use this managed identity to request tokens from Microsoft Entra ID.\n",
    "   - A unique service principal is created in Microsoft Entra ID, tied to the Azure resource's lifecycle\n",
    "   - The identity is automatically deleted when the associated Azure resource is deleted\n",
    "   - Exclusive to the Azure resource it's created for, limiting sharing across resources <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User-assigned Managed Identity**: When enabling an user-assigned managed identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Created independently as a standalone Azure resource\n",
    "   - A dedicated service principal is established in Microsoft Entra ID, managed separately\n",
    "   - This identity persists independently of the resources using it and must be explicitly deleted\n",
    "   - Can be shared across multiple Azure resources, offering flexibility in identity management\n",
    "\n",
    "System-assigned managed identities are ideal for single-resource workloads, where the identity is tied to that resource's lifecycle, whereas user-assigned managed identities are suited for multi-resource workloads requiring a shared identity. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of a multi-resource workload is a microservices architecture, where an application is decomposed into smaller, independently deployable services. Each service may run on a separate Azure resource, such as virtual machines, Azure Functions, or containerized instances. In this scenario, a user-assigned managed identity can be beneficial because it allows multiple services to share the same identity for secure access to shared resources, like databases or key vaults, while providing independent lifecycle management for the identity across these diverse resources.

    "### Working with Managed Identities\n",
    "\n",
    "When incorporating managed identities into your Azure resources, the process differs for user-assigned and system-assigned identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User-Assigned Managed Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a user-assigned managed identity, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "# Create a user-assigned managed identity\n",
    "az identity create -g myResourceGroup -n myUserAssignedIdentity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will create a new user-assigned managed identity named `myUserAssignedIdentity` within the specified resource group `myResourceGroup`. Upon successful execution, the command will return detailed information about the newly created user-assigned managed identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/UserAssignedOutput.png width=500 height=250> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the user-assigned managed identity, you have two options: create a new resource with the identity or assign the identity to an existing resource. To create a resource with the user-assigned managed identity, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az <resource> create --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --name <myResourceName> --assign-identity myUserAssignedIdentity --role contributor --scope <mySubscription>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will create a new Azure resource with the specified user-assigned managed identity. Adjust the `<resource>`, `<myResourceGroup>`,` <myResourceName>`, and `<mySubscription>` placeholders based on the resource type and your account details. Additional parameters may be required depending on the specific resource type you plan to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign the user-assigned managed identity to an existing resource use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az resource identity assign --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myResource --identities myUserAssignedIdentity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command associates the user-assigned managed identity (`myUserAssignedIdentity`) with an existing resource (`myResource`) in the specified resource group (`myResourceGroup`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System-Assigned Managed Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable a system-assigned managed identity during the creation of an Azure resource, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Enable system-assigned managed identity during the creation of an Azure resource\n",
    "az <resource> create --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --name <myResourceName> --assign-identity --role contributor --scope <mySubscription>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add system-assigned managed identity to an existing resource you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Add system-assigned managed identity to an existing Azure resource\n",
    "az <resource> identity assign --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --name <myResourceName>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To update an existing resource and enable system-assigned managed identity, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Update existing Azure resource to enable system-assigned managed identity\n",
    "az <resource> update --resource-group <myResourceGroup> --name <myResourceName> --enable-managed-identity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The first command (`az <resource> identity assign`) is specifically for assigning a system-assigned managed identity to a resource that didn't have it initially. The second command (`az <resource> update --enable-managed-identity`) enables the system-assigned managed identity feature for an existing resource. This means it activates the capability for the system to automatically create and manage the associated identity. The command itself doesn't explicitly assign a specific identity; instead, it allows the system to handle the identity creation and management automatically."

Enabling Managed Identity for an AKS cluster enhances security and simplifies authentication, allowing applications within the cluster to securely connect with Azure services, such as Azure Key Vault and Azure SQL Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable Managed Identity for an AKS cluster, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch a command-line interface on your local machine. Sign in to your Azure account using the Azure CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the following command to enable managed identity for an existing AKS cluster. Replace `<resource-group>` with the name of your AKS cluster's resource group and `<aks-cluster-name>` with your AKS cluster's name:\n",

RBAC ensures that users, services, and applications have precisely the required level of access, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions and enhancing overall security.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of AKS, RBAC plays a vital role in controlling access to various resources. In this section, we will focus on assigning roles to the Managed Identity of an AKS cluster, granting it the necessary permissions to interact seamlessly and securely with Azure Key Vault.\n",

    "At this point, if needed, it's beneficial to revisit the previous lesson, in which we covered different RBAC roles associated with Azure Key Vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will assign the *Key Vault Secrets Officer* role to the Managed Identity linked with your AKS cluster. This role provides permissions to read, list, set and delete secrets, certificates, and keys within the specified Azure Key Vault. \n",
