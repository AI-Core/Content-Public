    "\n",
    "In Azure Key Vault, *access policies* form the foundation of secure and controlled operations, dictating who can perform specific actions on stored secrets, keys, and certificates within the vault. These policies serve as a governance mechanism, clearly defining the scope of permissible actions on resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a Key Vault, you can select from two methods for managing access: *Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* and *Key Vault Access Policy*. These mechanisms define how permissions are granted within the Key Vault ecosystem. By default, Azure RBAC is selected during the creation process, unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Azure RBAC**, access permissions are managed through Azure's broader role-based access control system, allowing users to leverage existing roles and assignments within Microsoft Entra ID for access. In contrast, **Key Vault Access Policy** provides more granular control within the Key Vault itself, allowing users to define fine-tuned permissions for specific operations directly within the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RBAC Roles in Key Vault\n",
    "\n",
    "RBAC provides a set of predefined roles that govern access to Azure Key Vault. These roles include various levels of authority, allowing users to perform specific tasks or operations. Here are the primary RBAC roles associated with Azure Key Vault:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Vault Administrator**: The highest level of access, the **Key Vault Administrator** role grants full control over the Key Vault. Administrators can manage access policies, configure advanced settings, and perform any operation within the Key Vault.\n",

    "- **Key Vault Contributor**: **Key Vault Contributors** have broad permissions within the Key Vault, allowing them to manage all aspects except for access policies and advanced settings. They can add, update, and delete secrets, keys, and certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Vault Reader**: **Readers** have read-only access to the Key Vault. They can view configurations, secrets, and certificates but are unable to make modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "These roles represent the most important roles in RBAC, although additional roles exist to cater to specific operational needs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Specify a meaningful name for the new secret. It's best practice to choose names that are descriptive and reflective of the nature of the secret. For example, instead of a generic name like `Password1`, use a descriptive name like `API-AccessToken`. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Input the value of the secret\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Optionally, configure additional settings like activation and expiration dates. This step allows you to exert control over the secret's lifecycle. If these settings are left unselected, the secret will be created without specific activation or expiration dates. This means that the secret will be immediately active upon creation and will persist indefinitely unless manually deleted.\n",
