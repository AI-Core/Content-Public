    "## Container Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling Container Insights is a key step in harnessing the full power of Azure Monitor for monitoring containerized workloads. Container Insights provides you with detailed metrics and insights into the performance and health of your AKS clusters. Let's walk through the process of enabling Container Insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The steps below will show you how to enable Container Insights if you use your own free tier Azure account. For the specialisation project you won't need to enable managed identity on the cluster, or to assign any additional permissions to your Entra ID user. Instead, you will only need use the **Configure monitoring** button in the **Insights** tab as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step we will need to do before enabling Container Insights is to enable managed identity on the AKS cluster. You can do this using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az aks update -g {resource-group-name} -n {aks-cluster-name} --enable-managed-identity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `{resource-group-name}` with the name of the resource group where the AKS cluster has been deployed to, and `{aks-cluster-name}` with the name of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--enable-managed-identity` command allows the AKS cluster to use a Microsoft Entra ID identity instead of the Service Principal to authenticate with Azure services. To collect advanced data and metrics from the cluster, using Container Insights, the cluster needs to have managed identity enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to add some permissions our Service Principal. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** web page, identifying your own subscription. From here access the **Access control (IAM)** page. Use the **+ Add** -> **Add role assignment** button at the top of the page to add permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/AddAssignmeents.png width=650 height=250> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to add the following three roles, one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring Metrics Publisher**: Grants permission to publish monitoring metrics to Azure Monitor. This is important for applications and services that need to push metrics to Azure Monitor.\n",
    "- **Monitoring Contributor**: Grants broad permissions for monitoring and managing monitoring resources in Azure, including permissions to read and write monitoring settings, access monitoring data and manage monitoring resources\n",
    "- **Log Analytics Contributor**: Grants permissions to read and write access to Log Analytics workspaces. Includes permissions to query and analyze log data stored in those workspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should assign each of this role to your Service Principal application, in the **Members** page using the **+ Select members** button. This will open a page where you can search your Service Principal by name (in this case `myAppMaya`) and select it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/SelectMember.png width=750 height=350> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "After you assigned each of these three roles, we are finally ready to enable Container Insights for your cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Remember, the steps above are not necessary when working with the Azure credentials generated for your specialisation project. Moreso, you will not have enough permissions to perform those steps if you are trying to.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/ConfigureContainerInsights.png width=625 height=500> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observe the message above, stating that a Log Analytics workspace will be created automatically. Enabling Container Insights for your AKS cluster triggers Azure to generate a Log Analytics workspace with a unique name. This workspace acts as the central repository for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing logs and performance data from your AKS service, simplifying the setup process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click **Configure** to confirm the setup. Container Insights will then proceed to configure for your AKS cluster, which may take a few minutes. You can monitor the progress within the Azure Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the configuration is complete, you can explore the rich data and insights provided by Container Insights for your AKS cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Container Insights begins collecting data from your AKS cluster once activated. However, there may be a delay in data visibility, and it won't offer historical data prior to activation. To start viewing data, you'll need to interact with the cluster, for example by redeploying your applications to it."

    "### Exploring Container Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've enabled Container Insight for your AKS cluster, you will gain access to a set of tabs that provide in-depth insights into your containerized workloads. Let's walk through each tab and understand the information contained within them:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The **Cluster** Tab\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Cluster** tab provides an overview of your entire AKS cluster's performance and health. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/ClusterTab.png width=850 height=500> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key metrics included here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU Usage**: This critical metric measures the CPU utilization of the entire cluster. It provides an overarching view of your cluster's performance. Monitoring CPU usage helps you ensure that the cluster is operating efficiently and that there is no over-utilization or resource starvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: By tracking memory consumption across the cluster, you can guarantee that resources are allocated efficiently. Identifying memory-intensive workloads or potential memory leaks is essential for maintaining the health of your AKS cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node Count**: Keeping tabs on the number of nodes in your cluster is essential for understanding its scaling and resource allocation. Anomalies in node count can indicate scaling issues, resource constraints, or even potential underlying infrastructure problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pod Count**: This metric displays the total number of pods actively running within your cluster. Monitoring pod count helps you assess the demand on your cluster's resources. It can indicate workload spikes or irregularities in pod management.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can observe above there is some level of customization for these Container Insights. First, Container Insights allows you to select specific time frames for your charts. This feature enables you to zoom in on real-time data or expand your analysis to cover longer periods. Customizing the time range ensures that you're addressing the most relevant data based on your monitoring requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/TimeRange.png width=375 height=350> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Container Insight, you also have the ability to customize chart properties in a highly granular way. You can fine-tune your visualizations to emphasize specific performance indicators and customize your insight to meet your AKS cluster monitoring requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key advanced chart customization options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metric Aggregation**: You can select from various aggregation options, such as average, minimum, 50th percentile, 90th percentile, 95th percentile, and maximum. This allows you to delve deeper into the nuances of your cluster's performance by choosing the aggregation method that suits your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percentage Metrics**: For a more detailed view of your AKS cluster's performance, you can analyze metrics based on percentages. This enables you to gain insights into how resources are distributed and how different percentiles impact the cluster's operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Status Indicators**: Container Insights allows you to incorporate status indicators for various elements, such as pods and nodes. These indicators provide real-time feedback on the health and status of your cluster's components, helping you identify issues or bottlenecks instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to take some time to understand the nuances of what Container Insights can offer you. This will enable you to maximize your monitoring solutions."
