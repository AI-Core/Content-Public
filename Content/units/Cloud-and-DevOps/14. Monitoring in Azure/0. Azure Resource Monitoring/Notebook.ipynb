    "### Accessing Azure Monitor Features\n",
    "\n",
    "All Azure services generate data in the same formats. This means we can use the same tools to analyze data from all of them. Although the user interface may differ among services, they all provide a shared set of monitoring features accessible through the Azure portal. These menu options commonly include the **Overview** and **Activity log** page, along with various monitoring solutions available on the **Monitoring** page. Each of these can be conveniently accessed from the homepage of any individual service.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The **Overview** Page\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Overview** page offers comprehensive details about the selected service, often presenting its current state. Many Azure services include a **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** page, featuring charts that depict essential metrics. These charts provide a quick glance at the resource's operation. You can select any of the charts to open them in **Metrics Explorer** for a more in-depth analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/AKSOverview.png width=850 height=450> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of a few metrics that can appear in the **Overview** page of an AKS cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node Pool CPU Usage**: This metric reflects the CPU utilization of the nodes in your AKS cluster. It measures how much CPU capacity is being used by the node pool. High CPU usage might indicate resource-intensive workloads running on the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node Pool Network In**: This metric represents the incoming network traffic to the node pool within your AKS cluster. It indicates the amount of data received by the nodes. A sudden spike in network traffic may be a sign of increased incoming requests or data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node Pool Network Out**: This metric measures the outgoing network traffic from the nodes in your AKS cluster. It quantifies the data sent out from the nodes to external destinations. An increase in network out traffic could imply data transfers or communication with external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics allow you to quickly assess the health and performance of your Kubernetes environment. You can select any of these charts to gain a more in-depth analysis of the specific metric's trends and patterns by opening them in **Metrics Explorer**. You can do so by simply double-clicking on the desired metric graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Keep in mind that while we've discussed metrics for an AKS cluster here, each Azure service may have its unique set of metrics displayed on the **Overview** page. These metrics are tailored to the specific characteristics and functionalities of the service. However, the process of accessing and exploring these metrics remains consistent across Azure services.

    "\n",
    "- **Health Event Activated and Resolved**: These logs represent events where automated health checks or monitoring systems detected health issues within the AKS cluster. When activated, it indicates that an issue or anomaly was detected. When resolved, it suggests that the issue was identified and corrected. These logs can be valuable for tracking the cluster's operational stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Get Managed Cluster Access Profile by Terraform**: This log signifies an event where a Terraform script or configuration retrieved the access profile for the managed AKS cluster. It might include information about the requester and the purpose of accessing the profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Scaling Activity**: You may also encounter logs related to resource scaling activities. These include events like scaling up or down the number of nodes or pods in the AKS cluster to accommodate changes in workload demand. These logs provide insights into how the cluster adapts to workload variations.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Scope**: The **Scope** option allows you to specify the Azure resource or resource group you want to monitor. You can choose to focus on a single resource or extend the scope to multiple resources or resource groups, although not all resources support this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metric Namespace**: The **Metric Namespace** helps you narrow down your metric selection to a specific category. It categorizes metrics based on the type of Azure resource or the service they are associated with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metric**: The metric selection enables you to choose the specific metric you wish to analyze. Metrics vary based on the Azure resource being monitored and may include options such as CPU usage, memory usage, throughput, latency and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation**: You can specify how the metric data is aggregated over time. Aggregation options include average, sum, count, minimum, maximum, and others. For example, you can analyze the CPU usage metric by calculating the average values over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Time**: Enabling this allows you to view metric data in your local time zone, making the analysis more contextually relevant to your geographical location. This tab also allows you to select the time range for your metrics exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=center> <img src=images/MetricExplorerTimeRange.png width=750 height=400> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Filter**: You can refine your analysis further by adding filters to your metrics. These filters can include specific resource instances, attributes, or other criteria to focus your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Split By**: This feature enables you to break down metric data by another dimension, providing insights into specific aspects of the Azure resource. For example, you can split metrics by different resource instances, regions, or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's important to note that you can enable *Container Insights* in the Metrics Explorer (under **Metric Namespace**), which provides more detailed metrics specifically designed for monitoring containerized workloads. Container Insights offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collection of performance metrics and logs from your AKS containers\n",
    "- Pre-built dashboards for visualizing container performance, node health, and cluster-level metrics\n",
    "- Integration with Azure Monitor, enabling alerts and notifications based on container health and performance thresholds\n",
