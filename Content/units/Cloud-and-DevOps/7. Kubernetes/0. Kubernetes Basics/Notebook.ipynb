    "- __Self-healing:__ If a container is down, i.e. not responding to health checks, Kubernetes will spin up a replacement.\n",
    "- __Auto-scaling:__ If the given containers are not enough to process all the requirements, Kubernetes can deploy more containers within the cluster. Conversely, if the resources are in excess, Kubernetes can destroy some to maintain balance.\n",
    "- __Discoverability:__ Each container can be accessed by its name (or IP) and port.\n",
    "- __Load balancing:__ If a single node is overloaded by high traffic, Kubernetes distributes the load among several nodes.\n",
