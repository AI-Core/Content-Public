    "> `Kubernetes` provides two resources for managing persistent storage: `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These allow us to abstract how storage is provided and expended.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PersistentVolume\n",
    "\n",
    "A persistent volume refers to a storage volume in a cluster provisioned by an administrator. Persistent volumes are 'physical' volumes on the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Characteristics of persistent volumes*\n",
    "\n",
    "- They have resources in the cluster (similar to `Node`s).\n",
    "- They are volume plugins similar to `volume`s described above.\n",
    "- __Their lifetime is independent of that of any pod.__\n",
    "- When bounded, they can be used similarly to `volume`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PersistentVolumeClaim\n",
    "\n",
    "A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request for the platform to create a PV on your behalf. To do this, it will search for any 'available' PersistentVolume that meets the specified requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Features*\n",
    "- Conceptually similar to `POD`s:\n",
    "    - `POD`s consume `Node` resources, whereas `PVC`s consume `PV` resources.\n",
    "    - `POD`s can request specific resources (e.g. RAM), whereas `PVC`s can request specific sizes and access modes (e.g. `read` and `write`).\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Provisioning\n",
    "\n",
    "`PV`s can be provisioned in two ways:\n",
    "- `statically`: cluster admin creates `PV`s for consumption.\n",
    "- `dynamically`: cluster attempts to dynamically provision appropriate `PV`s based on the `PersistentVolumClaim`'s __`StorageClasses`__ (the administrator has to provision the `StorageClass`, which will be __described later__).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Features*\n",
    "- __`Dynamic provision` will always match the requirements of the `PVC`.__\n",
    "- __`Static Provision` must at least match the given claim__ (e.g. a claim of `50GB` might be given `100Gb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reclaim Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user is finished with a volume, they can delete the PVC objects from the API, which allows the reclamation of the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three approaches for reclaiming the resource:\n",
    "- [`retain`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#retain): leave the data as-is (leave `PersistentVolume` and external storage.\n",
    "- [`delete`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#delete): delete `PersistentVolume` __and external storage__. This is the default approach for `Dynamic Provisioning`, although it is configurable.\n",
    "- [`recycle`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#recycle): (__now deprecated; dynamic provisioning should be used instead__).\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes can exist in any of the four states:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Available`: the volume is ready to be bound to a pod.\n",
    "- `Bound`: the CLI shows the pod to which the `PersistentVolume` is bound.\n",
    "- `Released`: the `PesistentVolumeClaim` has ended; however, the resource is yet to be reclaimed by the `cluster`.\n",
    "- `Failed`: reclamation failed."

    "3. `.spec.accessModes`: stipulates how data can be accessed.\n",

    "__If the data should be shared between pods or preserved, use `PersistentVolumes`.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereafter, determine if dynamic provisioning is required (it is difficult to know beforehand how much storage is required).\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, create the following:\n",
    "- `PersistentVolume` `.yml` config (defines how a `volume` is created).\n",
    "- `PersistentVolumeClaim` `.yml` config (specifies how a `volume` is requested).\n",
    "- `MyApplication` `.yml` config (the `workload resource`; __remember to avoid bare pods__).\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, dynamic provisioning is required, add another `.yml` config file to the steps above:\n",
    "- `StorageClass` `.yml` config (acts as a template for giving out `PersistentVolume`s to pods in need).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __This should be used for large-scale apps, where 'by-hand' provisioning is not feasible due to the following reasons:__\n",

    "- There are many pods requesting a high storage allocation.\n",

    "In a nutshell, StatefulSets are a type of workload resource (that manages pods) that adds a storage volume to the pod. This way, all the data associated with the pod will be stored and can be reused the next time the same pod is run, hence the name 'Stateful'. This is useful, for example, for running a pod that depends on a database where the data is stored (e.g. an SQL database)."
