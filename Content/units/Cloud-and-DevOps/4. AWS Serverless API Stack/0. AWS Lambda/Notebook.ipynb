    "## Introduction\n",
    "> AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that enables code to run in response to events, without requiring backend server and runtime management, workload-aware cluster logic creation, or event-integration maintenance. It allows us to run code for any type of application or backend service with zero administration.\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- __No severs to manage:__ Lambda turns on a machine, runs your code on it, then turns it off.\n",
    "- __Continuous scaling:__ Lambda automatically scales your application and runs in response to each event simply by spinning up more instances of the lambda function in parallel.\n",
    "- __Cost optimisation:__ It optimises cost significantly.\n",
    "- __Millisecond response times:__ Fast response times, and optimised memory allocation.\n",
    "- __Free requests:__ It comes with __1 million__ free requests a month with AWS."

    "## Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that executes on AWS Lambda is called a _lambda function_. They are literally functions which you write in the AWS console in the programming language of your choice. Once created, it will always be available to run when triggered. Each created function will have both the code and the associated configuration information required for it to run. This allows each function to be __stateless__, meaning that there is no need to persist any information between different invokations. Every function is self-contained, without external dependencies. Thus, multiple copies of the function may be launched as required to keep up with incoming requests and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions can also be easily integrated with specific AWS resources, such as Amazon S3, API Gateway, Lex or Cognito, and even call other Lambda functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions can be configured to be triggered by many different events, including:\n",
    "- when a request is received by an API\n",
    "- when an item is inserted into a database\n",
    "- on a regular schedule\n",
    "- and many, many more ways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Extend the logic of other AWS resources:__ When a change is made to the resource, such as an Amazon S3 bucket, the lambda function can be configured to execute, managing the incoming data.\n",
    "- __Develop code:__ With Lambda, there are no new languages or tools to learn. You can leverage any third-party library or package (frameworks, SDKs, libraries and more) by packaging them with the function in what is known as a _Lambda layer_. Currently, lambda natively supports Java, Go, Powershell, Node.js, C#, Python and Ruby.\n",
    "- __Zero administration:__ Lambda manages all your infrastructure on a highly fault-tolerant infrastructure, allowing you to focus on building services instead of managing servers.\n",
    "- __High scalability:__ Lambda functions are only run when required. Thus, they will execute, matching the rate of incoming requests without any configuration. The functions run within milliseconds after an event is triggered and only execute for the required time to fulfill the requests down to the millisecond. "
