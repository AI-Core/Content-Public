    "## Introduction\n",
    "> AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS that allows you to monitor your AWS resources in real-time. CloudWatch monitors your data in the form of logs, events and metrics, providing you with insights into all your AWS applications and services. CloudWatch can be employed to detect undesirable application behaviour, set alarms, visualise logs/metrics, troubleshoot applications and take automated actions to keep services running.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general overview of CloudWatch, visit the CloudWatch homepage [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), and check what is included in the free tier of the service [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)."

    "\n",
    "* AWS CloudWatch enables you to collect logs, metrics and events from a large volume of data from your AWS and display this **information in a centralised location**.  \n",
    "* It enables easy metric collection from your AWS resources. CloudWatch **seamlessly integrates with over 70 AWS services** and publishes their metrics.\n",
    "* CloudWatch allows you to **set up alarms and automate actions** based on thresholds or, in the case of machine-learning models, unexpected behaviour in the metrics.\n",
    "* It offers the possibility to **explore, analyse and visualise logs,** allowing you to troubleshoot any issue with your services efficiently and rapidly, thereby reducing downtime."
