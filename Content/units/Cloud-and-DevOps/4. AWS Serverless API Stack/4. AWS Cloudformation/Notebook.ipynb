    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> AWS CloudFormation is an AWS service that sets up and manages AWS resource and service infrastructures. It allows you to define '**infrastructure as Code**', allowing you more time to focus on building your AWS applications. By defining a YAML or JSON template, you can describe all the AWS resources required (e.g. EC2, RDS or S3) by your application, and CloudFormation will handle the provisioning of those resources on your behalf. \n",
    "\n",
    "For full details on the features of AWS CloudFormation, consult the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplify application-infrastructure creation:** Consider a case where an application infastruture is to deploy an EC2 instance and an S3 bucket with the correct security permissions. Doing this manually can be very time-consuming. By defining the process in a template, another instance of this infrastructure can quickly be created in a few clicks.\n",
    "* **Replicate your architecture:** Since the CloudFormation infrastructure is defined in code by your template, you can easily reuse the template to deploy the same infastruture to another AWS region.\n",
    "* **Track changes easily:** If a problem occurs while making changes to your infrastructure, e.g. updating the security permission to your EC2 instance, you would need to remember the previous settings. CloudFormation provides a rollback feature to enable you to use a previous version of your template if a problem occurs; it also tracks the changes made.\n",
    "* **Free:** CloudFormation is fully free to use; however, note that the services your define in your template will have the normal associated costs. Each template is allotted a limited quota during creation, which can be viewed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## CloudFormation Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Template:** A template can be specified in JSON or YAML format, and it acts as the blueprint for your AWS infrastructure. It will define the resources used and how they are configured when added to the stack.\n",
    "* **Stack:** After configuring your AWS template and deploying it, your resources will be managed in a single object called a stack. From the stack, you can update, delete and create resources on your stack defined by the template. \n",
    "* **Change sets:** These allow you to generate a summary of the proposed changes to be made to your stack before updating it. Since AWS destroys the previous stack when updating to a new one, you can view the changes to ensure no critical elements are affected during the update. \n"

    "## Creating CloudFormation Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using CloudFormation, we must design a template that can be uploaded to create our stack. Although we can create the template in YAML or JSON format, we will be using YAML for this lesson. The YAML template is where you will configure your AWS resources to be added to your stack. The full available structure of an AWS CloudFormation template can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html). "

    "Below is a basic template that defines a simple AWS CloudFormation stack configuring an EC2 instance. The general process of creating a CloudFormation template will involve defining the AWS resources that your CloudFormation stack will contain and subsequently defining the properties of each of the resources. In the example, we have defined a new Unbuntu EC2 instance. Notice that the properties of the resource (ImageId, InstanceType and Amazon EBS storage) are relevant to an EC2 instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "We initially define the version of the template and provide a description. Thereafter, we add the resources of the template, in our case, an EC2 instance, followed by the properties of that resource. To know what resources are available to you and their corresponding properties, consult the AWS CloudFormation documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html). \n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, in this case, we know to specify it as a string in our template, and we need to specify it here or in the ``LaunchTemplate`` property. Hence, it is not required, and we do not have to specify it here. We also know that when the CloudFormation stack updates, the ``ImageId`` will be replaced. This is how you determine what properties and resources to define in your template. We will also configure the ``InstanceType`` as ``t2.micro``(Free Tier) before finalising the template. \n",
