    "## Introduction\n",
    "> **Amazon API Gateway** is an AWS service that allows the creation, maintenance and securing of scalable **REST**, **HTTP** and **Websocket** APIs. APIs can be created to access AWS services or other web services and data stored in the AWS Cloud. As a developer, you can use the service to create APIs that serve your client's applications or that are available to third-party app developers."

    "* **REST APIs** are the de facto standard for client-server communication. Although REST APIs have a higher latency rate than HTTP APIs, they have full endpoint support, supporting edge-optimised, regional and private endpoints. They also support endpoint caching and response validation, unlike HTTP APIs.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "* **HTTP APIs** were created to be the version of REST APIs that offers relatively low latency rates and cost implementation. Amazon created this API in 2019 and reported that it can offer up to a 60% reduction in latency. However, it does not offer as many features as REST APIs, and it only has regional endpoint support on AWS.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Websocket APIs** allow full-duplex communication between client and server. Simply put, communication can be initiated in both directions. The client can send requests to the server AND the server can send requests to the client. They can be used to create real-time applications, such as messaging applications, where the server might send you a notification, and you might send it a message for a friend.\n",

Here, you can select the type of API you want to build (HTTP, REST or WebSocket) or import your externally developed API. For this example, we will be building a new REST API. Select build from the REST API option to create a new REST API. The goal is to create a REST API which integrates with a lambda function that facilitates machine-learning model predictions.\n",

By creating a proxy resource with the **{proxy+}** parameter and the **ANY** method, you can provide your integration with access to all available resources. A more detailed explanation of proxy integrations can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html).
