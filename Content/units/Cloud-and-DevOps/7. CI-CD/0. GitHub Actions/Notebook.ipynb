    "# CI, CD & GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    ">GitHub Actions allow us to automate various stages of software development if GitHub is employed as the version-control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Key characteristics of GitHub actions__*\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Event-driven:__ Within a GitHub repository, it is possible to automate the execution of a piece of code (e.g. pull request) based on event triggers.\n",
    "- __Configuration-oriented:__ `.yaml` is employed to configure the necessary __workflows.__\n",
    "- __Customisable:__ We can create custom GitHub Actions with `docker` or JavaScript.\n",
    "- __Supports simple continuous integration (CI):__ Each pull request/merge can be automatically tested.\n",
    "- __Supports simple continuous deployment/delivery (CD):__ After successful testing, we can create a pipeline that automatically deploys the code for others to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous integration\n",
    "\n",
    "> __This refers to the integration of software changes from multiple contributors.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, this includes\n",
    "- assessing the code quality (via automated code assessment, reviews or both).\n",
    "- assessing adherence to the project's best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above and more can be achieved using GitHub Actions in order to streamline the code-merging process (e.g. assign labels automatically). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "> __This refers to the testing of production code to ensure that it is always ready for deployment (i.e. bug-free).__\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, this includes\n",
    "- inspecting changes against integration tests (or a whole suite of them).\n",
    "- testing every feature that is to be merged.\n",
    "- rapid deployment of necessary fixes (users always have the best possible version of the product available).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "> __This refers to the automatic deployment or code after testing and approval.__\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often confused with continuous deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "__This approach may not be suitable for every project and may be difficult to achieve. However, it offers significant benefits if done correctly.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, one could set up, amongst others,\n",
    "- automated/easy rollbacks (to catch critical flaws when tests fail),\n",
    "- test optimisation to ensure that only the necessary tests are conducted to improve speed and reduce cost,\n",
    "- automated deployment of the changes to production (e.g. creating images and containers, and deploying them on Kubernetes as a new version of the software)."

    "## GitHub Actions Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concepts in GitHub Actions include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Events:__ Anything that occurs inside the repository, e.g. new issue, pull request, and merging (__external events are allowed via [webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event)__).\n",
    "- __Workflow:__ Automated processes added to the repository.\n",
    "- __Jobs:__ Set of steps running on the same machine.\n",
    "- __Steps:__ Individual tasks that can run __action__/shell commands on the machine.\n",
    "- __Action:__ Standalone commands __set up individually in separate/the same GitHub repository.__\n",
    "- __Runner:__ A server with [Github Actions runner](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-latex) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/github-actions-design.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "- The full list of events for triggering workflows can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).\n",
    "- __Jobs in a workflow run in parallel by default.__\n",
    "- __Dependencies can be created between jobs__ (e.g. deployment relies on the success of the testing job).\n",
    "- __Any publicly set-up Action can be used__ (e.g. see the Action for creating LaTex documents [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-latex)).\n",
    "- __Runners are provided by GitHub for free__ (see the limits for different tiers [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration)).\n",
    "- It is also possible to set up custom runners."

    "To use GitHub Actions, the following are required:\n",
    "- an appropriate folder in our repository containing workflows (`/.github/workflows`).\n",

    "## Jobs Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "> GitHub Actions allow us to specify the jobs that must achieve completion before the current one runs.\n",

    "Using this approach, we can easily create many similar jobs via __variable substitution__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few things to note:\n",
    "- The maximum number of jobs that can be generated this way is `256`.\n",
    "- Ordering matters; the first defined option will be the first job.\n",

    "- `{to, from}JSON(value)`: returns the JSON pretty-printed value of `value`, e.g. `toJSON(job)` might return `{ \"status\": \"Success\" }`.\n",
