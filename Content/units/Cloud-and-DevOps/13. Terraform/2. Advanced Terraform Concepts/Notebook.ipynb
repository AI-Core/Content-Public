    "## Terraform State Management \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Terraform state* is a critical component of Terraform's workflow. It represents the current state of your infrastructure and serves as the source of truth for Terraform. The state file is a record of the relationships and properties of the resources defined in your Terraform configuration. It contains essential information such as resource IDs, IP addresses, DNS names, and other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform state is essential because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tracks Resource State**: Terraform uses it to compare the desired state with the current state of resources, enabling precise updates\n",
    "- **Manages Resource Dependencies**: It helps Terraform provision resources in the correct order and resolves dependencies accurately\n",
    "- **Enables State Locking**: State locking prevents concurrent updates, enhancing stability and data integrity\n",
    "- **Stores Critical Data**: It persists valuable infrastructure data for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local vs Remote State File\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Terraform stores state information locally in a file named `terraform.tfstate`. The state file is created in the working directory where you run Terraform commands, unless you specify a different path or use a remote state backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a `JSON` or binary file that stores details about the resources defined in your configuration, such as their attributes and dependencies. Terraform uses this information to plan and apply changes to your infrastructure. You can check out the contents of this file for yourself after running `terraform apply` in your project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works well for small-scale projects and individual use cases. However, local state has limitations when it comes to team collaboration and larger projects. To address the limitations of local state, Terraform allows you to store state remotely using various backends. Remote state offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Remote state enables collaboration among team members. Multiple users can work on the same infrastructure project without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrency Control**: Remote state backends often provide locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent modifications, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security**: Sensitive data can be better protected in remote state backends. Access controls and encryption are typically available, reducing the risk of data exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scaling**: Remote state works well for larger projects and complex infrastructures where multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) need to be managed\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular choices for remote state backends include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amazon S3**: Store state files in Amazon S3 buckets, which can be secured and versioned\n",
    "- **Azure Blob Storage**: Azure users can leverage Azure Blob Storage for storing remote state files\n",
    "- **HashiCorp Terraform Cloud**: A Terraform Cloud workspace serves as a centralized remote backend that provides version control, collaboration, and additional features\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of configuring Terraform for Azure Blob Storage backend. First before configuring this, you will need to have an Azure Storage Account. Then in your Terraform configuration file (typically `main.tf`) you can configure the backend to use Blob Storage, as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hsl\n",
    "# main.tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure Terraform to use Azure Blob Storage as a remote backend\n",
    "terraform {\n",
    "  backend \"azurerm\" {\n",
    "    resource_group_name   = \"your-resource-group\"         # Replace with your resource group name\n",
    "    storage_account_name  = \"your-storage-account\"        # Replace with your storage account name\n",
    "    container_name        = \"your-container-name\"          # Replace with your container name\n",
    "    key                   = \"terraform.tfstate\"            # Specify the state file name\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you would need to replace the placeholders with the actual values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"your-resource-group\"`: The name of the Azure resource group containing the storage account\n",
    "- `\"your-storage-account\"`: The name of your Azure Storage Account\n",
    "- `\"your-container-name\"`: The name of the container within the storage account where the state file will be stored\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of State Locking\n",
    "\n",
    "**State locking** is a mechanism used in Terraform to prevent simultaneous writes to the Terraform state file. The Terraform state file contains the current state of the managed infrastructure, including resource IDs, attribute values, and other critical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "State locking typically involves acquiring a lock on the state file before any modifications are made and releasing the lock once the modifications are complete. This ensures that only one user or process can make changes to the state file at any given time, preventing conflicts and data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "State locking can be achieved through different methods, depending on the chosen state backend:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote State Backends**: Many remote state backends (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Storage) provide built-in locking mechanisms. Terraform interacts with the remote backend to acquire and release locks automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local State Backends**: For local state backends, external locking mechanisms such as file locking are often employed. Terraform users must configure and manage these locking mechanisms themselves."

    "## Terraform Workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Terraform workspaces* are a feature that enables you to manage multiple instances of the same infrastructure in separate environments, such as development, staging, and production. Each workspace maintains its own state, variables, and configuration settings, providing a clean separation between different environments. This isolation prevents accidental configuration changes and simplifies collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each workspace maintains its own state file (e.g., `terraform.tfstate.dev`/`terraform.tfstate` for the `dev` workspace). This ensures that resources created in one workspace don't interfere with resources in another workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using workspaces, you can initialize a new workspace with the `terraform workspace new` command. For example, to create a new workspace named `dev`, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "terraform workspace new dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates a new workspace and automatically switches to it. You can also switch between workspaces using the `terraform workspace select` command. For example, to switch to the `staging` workspace, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "terraform workspace select staging\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command switches to the `staging` workspace and loads its associated state and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When you apply changes using `terraform apply`, Terraform will apply the configuration for the currently selected workspace. For instance, if you're in the `staging` workspace, applying changes will only affect the `staging` environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can list available workspaces using `terraform workspace list` and delete workspaces using `terraform workspace delete`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "# List available workspaces\n",
    "terraform workspace list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete a workspace (e.g., \"dev\")\n",
    "terraform workspace delete dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Environment-Specific Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Terraform configuration files, you can define variables that are specific to each workspace. This allows you to customize configurations for different environments. For instance, you can have variables in a `variables.tf` file like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "variable \"region\" {\n",
    "  description = \"The AWS region for resources.\"\n",
    "  type        = string\n",
    "  default     = \"us-east-1\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "variable \"instance_count\" {\n",
    "  description = \"The number of instances to launch.\"\n",
    "  type        = number\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can set workspace-specific values for these variables using environment-specific variable files (e.g., `dev.tfvars`, `staging.tfvars`, and `prod.tfvars`) or directly using the `-var` flag when running Terraform commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Environment Isolation with Workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clean Separation**: Workspaces allow you to maintain a clean separation between different environments, reducing the risk of configuration conflicts or unintended changes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Collaboration**: Teams can work simultaneously on different environments without interfering with each other's configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Easy Environment Replication**: You can easily replicate environments (e.g., clone a staging environment to create a new testing environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State Management**: Each workspace maintains its own state, making it easier to manage state files and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variable Customization**: Customize variables for each environment, ensuring flexibility while maintaining code reusability"

    "## Handling Dependencies and Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource dependencies represent the order in which Terraform creates, updates, and deletes resources. We have briefly seen in the previous lesson that you can explicitly define dependencies between resources using the `depends_on` attribute. This ensures that certain resources are created or updated before others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "resource \"aws_instance\" \"web\" {\n",
    "  ami           = \"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\"\n",
    "  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "resource \"aws_security_group\" \"web\" {\n",
    "  name_prefix = \"web-\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a dependency relationship\n",
    "resource \"aws_network_interface_sg_attachment\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  security_group_id    = aws_security_group.web.id\n",
    "  network_interface_id = aws_instance.web.network_interface_ids[0]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explicitly specify the dependency\n",
    "depends_on = [aws_instance.web]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the `aws_network_interface_sg_attachment` resource depends on the `aws_instance.web` resource using the `depends_o`n attribute. This means that Terraform will ensure the `aws_instance.web` resource is created before attempting to create the `aws_network_interface_sg_attachment` resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Resource Lifecycles\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform resources have three main lifecycle stages: create, update, and delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create**: When a resource is created, Terraform provisions the resource in your infrastructure. This typically happens when running `terraform apply`.\n",
    "- **Update**: During an update, Terraform detects changes to the resource's configuration and attempts to update the resource to match the desired state defined in your configuration. Terraform can perform in-place updates or replace the resource entirely, depending on the changes.\n",
    "- **Delete**: When a resource is deleted, Terraform destroys the resource in your infrastructure. This typically happens when running `terraform destroy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Resource Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Resource drift* occurs when the actual state of a resource in your infrastructure differs from the desired state defined in your Terraform configuration. To detect and manage drift, Terraform provides the `terraform refresh` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `terraform refresh` command queries the current state of your resources and updates the Terraform state file without making any changes to your infrastructure. It's a useful tool for identifying differences between your configuration and the real-world state."

    "## Advanced Provisioning and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In Terraform, you can go beyond basic resource provisioning by leveraging advanced techniques to customize and manage your infrastructure efficiently. This section explores several advanced concepts and practices, including customizing user data for instances, dynamic block definitions, and using the `for_each` and `count` meta-arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing User Data for Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "When provisioning cloud instances, you often need to customize their configuration with user data. User data allows you to run scripts, install software, and perform various configuration tasks during instance initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "resource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  ami           = \"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\"\n",
    "  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  user_data = <<-EOF\n",
    "              #!/bin/bash\n",
    "              echo \"Hello, Terraform!\"\n",
    "              EOF\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `user_data` attribute is used to specify a Bash script that runs when the AWS instance starts. You can use user data to automate tasks such as software installation, package updates, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Block Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic block definitions in Terraform allow you to create and manage resource configurations dynamically. This is particularly useful when you have a variable number of similar resources to provision.\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "variable \"subnets\" {\n",
    "  type    = list(string)\n",
    "  default = [\"subnet-1\", \"subnet-2\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "resource \"aws_security_group_rule\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  type        = \"ingress\"\n",
    "  from_port   = 80\n",
    "  to_port     = 80\n",
    "  protocol    = \"tcp\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  dynamic \"cidr_blocks\" {\n",
    "    for_each = var.subnets\n",
    "    content {\n",
    "      cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/24\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  security_group_id = aws_security_group.example.id\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the dynamic block defines multiple `aws_security_group_rule` resources, each associated with a different subnet specified in the `var.subnets` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `for_each` and `count` Meta-Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for_each` and `count` meta-arguments provide powerful ways to create multiple instances of a resource or customize resource configurations based on input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `for_each`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "variable \"instance_names\" {\n",
    "  type    = map(string)\n",
    "  default = {\n",
    "    web     = \"Web Server\"\n",
    "    db      = \"Database Server\"\n",
    "    app     = \"Application Server\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "resource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  for_each = var.instance_names\n",
    "\n",
    "  ami           = \"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\"\n",

    "    Name = each.key\n",
    "    Role = each.value\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `for_each` meta-argument creates multiple AWS instances based on the keys and values in the `var.instance_names` map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `count`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "variable \"instance_count\" {\n",
    "  type    = number\n",
    "  default = 3\n",

    "  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n",
    "}\n",
