    "## Terraform Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure resources through code, bringing software development practices to infrastructure management. In IaC, infrastructure configurations are defined and managed using code files, allowing for automation, version control, and collaboration. The key principles of IaC include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automation**: IaC automates the process of provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources, reducing manual, error-prone tasks. Terraform automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources using declarative configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Control**: IaC configurations are stored in version control systems, enabling tracking of changes, collaboration, and rollback to previous states. Terraform configurations are code files that can be versioned and stored in git repositories, allowing teams to manage changes systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: IaC promotes the creation of reusable code modules, improving efficiency and consistency. *Terraform modules* enable the creation of reusable infrastructure components that can be shared across projects. We will cover Terraform modules extensively in a later lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency**: IaC ensures that infrastructure is provisioned consistently across environments, reducing configuration drift\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Declarative Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, Terraform uses a declarative configuration to provision resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In a **declarative approach**, you specify what the desired end state of the system should be, without specifying the step-by-step instructions to achieve it. It focuses on the \"what\" rather than the \"how.\" Terraform follows a declarative approach, where you define the desired infrastructure state, and Terraform figures out how to make it so.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the opposing side lies the **imperative approach**, where you specify the exact steps or instructions needed to achieve a particular outcome. It focuses on the \"how.\" Imperative approaches are often used in scripting and traditional configuration management tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of using declarative configuration include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Declarative configurations are typically simpler to read and understand because they describe the desired state without detailing the execution steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idempotence**: Declarative configurations are idempotent, meaning you can apply them multiple times without causing issues. Terraform will only make changes if necessary to bring the system to the desired state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictability**: Declarative configurations provide a clear view of what the infrastructure should look like, making it easier to anticipate the results of changes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Declarative configurations allow Terraform to understand resource dependencies and execute actions in parallel when possible, improving efficiency\n"

    "## Structure of a Terraform Configuration File\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Terraform configuration files* are the heart of Terraform and define the desired state of your infrastructure. These configurations are written in *HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)* and serve as a declarative way to describe the resources, settings, and dependencies needed for your infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform uses these configurations to plan, create, modify, or delete resources in various cloud providers, data centers, or other infrastructure platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of Terraform configurations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resources**: *Resources* represent the infrastructure components you want to create and manage. These could be virtual machines, databases, networks, storage accounts, security groups, and more. Each resource is defined using a *resource block* within your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Configuration**: Within each **resource block**, you specify the configuration settings for the resource. These settings include attributes like name, location, size, access control, and any other properties relevant to the resource type. The configuration defines how the resource should be created and configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependencies**: Resources can depend on each other. Terraform understands these dependencies and ensures that resources are created or modified in the correct order. You can express dependencies explicitly in your configuration to indicate relationships between resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables**: Terraform configurations can include variables to parameterize your configuration. Variables allow you to make your configuration more dynamic and reusable by passing values to resources, providers, and other elements of your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outputs**: Output blocks allow you to expose specific information about created resources. These outputs can be used to obtain information about the infrastructure after it's provisioned, and they are often used for downstream processes or other parts of your infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In Terraform, the basic structure of configurations is built around the following key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Extension**: Terraform configuration files typically have a `.tf` file extension. These `.tf` files contain the definitions of your infrastructure components, services, or entities you want to create and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource Blocks**: The configuration is organized into blocks, identified by their block type (e.g., `resource`, `variable`, `provider`) and enclosed in braces `{}`. Resource blocks are used to declare the infrastructure you intend to create or manage. They typically consist of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Resource Type**: This identifies the kind of resource you want to create, such as an AWS EC2 instance or an Azure virtual network. The resource type is specified as a string, and it serves as a reference to the resource provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Resource Name**: The resource name is a user-defined label or identifier for the specific instance of the resource you are creating. It helps differentiate between multiple instances of the same resource type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arguments**: Within these blocks, you use key-value pairs to set configuration parameters. These key-value pairs are called arguments. Arguments define the specific settings and attributes for the associated resources or block types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comments**: Comments in Terraform configurations are preceded by the `#` symbol. Comments serve as a way to include explanatory notes and descriptions within your configuration files, helping you and others understand the purpose and functionality of various sections of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualization purposes, here's an example of a basic resource block and its arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "# example Terraform resource configuration\n",
    "resource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  ami           = \"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\"\n",
    "  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n",
    "  tags = {\n",
    "    Name = \"example-instance\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `aws_instance` is the resource type, and `example` is the resource identified (a label for this particular resource block used to uniquely identify this resource within the Terraform configuration). The `ami`, `instance_type` and `tags` field together with their corresponding values represent the key-value pairs of arguments."

   "source": [
    "## Providers \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Terraform providers* are an important part of Terraform, as they define how Terraform interacts with various infrastructure platforms and services. Providers are responsible for understanding the APIs and resources offered by a specific platform, allowing Terraform to create, modify, or delete those resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about providers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plugin-Based**: Providers are implemented as plugins, which are external software components that extend the functionality of Terraform itself.  These plugins allow Terraform to interact with and manage resources on various infrastructure platforms, cloud providers, on-premises systems, and external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Authentication**: Providers require authentication credentials, which can be configured securely using environment variables or other methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configuration**: Each provider has its own configuration settings, such as API endpoints and access keys, which are specified in Terraform configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform supports a rich set of providers, enabling users to manage resources across various cloud providers, including but not limited to: AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, *HashiCorp Consul* and *Vault* and Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HashiCorp Consul** is a service discovery tool that helps applications find and communicate with one another in distributed environments, providing crucial features for modern microservices architectures. **HashiCorp Vault** is a secrets management and data protection tool, allowing organizations to securely store and manage sensitive information while also offering data encryption and security features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provider configuration is an essential part of your Terraform configuration file. It is used to specify the cloud or infrastructure platform you want to interact with. For instance, if you plan to provision resources on AWS or Azure, you must configure the respective provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providers are configured using a `provider` block. Inside this block, you provide information such as the provider's name and access credentials, enabling Terraform to authenticate and interact with the chosen platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to configure a provider block for AWS:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "provider \"aws\" {\n",
    "  region     = \"us-east-1\"\n",
    "  access_key = \"your-access-key\"\n",
    "  secret_key = \"your-secret-key\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Variables in Terraform \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables play a crucial role in Terraform by making configurations more flexible and reusable. They allow you to parameterize your infrastructure code, enabling you to adapt your deployments to different environments, scenarios, or changing requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Declare a Variable in Your Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To use variables in Terraform, you declare them in your Terraform configuration file using the `variable` block. This block defines the variable's name, type, and optional default value. Here's an example of how to declare a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "variable \"instance_type\" {\n",
    "  description = \"The type of EC2 instance to create.\"\n",
    "  type        = string\n",
    "  default     = \"t2.micro\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `variable` is the keyword that starts the variable block\n",
    "-  `instance_type` is the name of the variable. You will reference it using this name in your configuration.\n",
    "-  `description` provides a brief explanation of what the variable is used for. It's a good practice to include description for clarity.\n",
    "-  `type` specifies the data type of the variable. In this example, it's set to `string`, but you can use other types like `number`, `list`, `map` (a data type used to define key-value pairs), etc.  \n",
    "- `default` (optional) sets a default value for the variable. If no value is provided when using the variable, it will default to `t2.micro`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the Variable in Your Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've declared variables, you can reference them throughout your Terraform configuration. Variables can be used within resource blocks, data blocks, outputs, and other parts of your configuration. Here's an example of how to use the `instance_type` variable within a resource block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "resource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  ami           = \"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\"\n",
    "  instance_type = var.instance_type\n",
    "  tags = {\n",
    "    Name = \"example-instance\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this snippet, we use `var.instance_type` to reference the value of the `instance_type` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating variables into your Terraform workflow, you can create more adaptable and efficient infrastructure code that meets your specific needs and can evolve with your requirements."

    "## Data Sources in Terraform\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Data sources* in Terraform allow you to retrieve information from external systems, query existing resources, or fetch data that you can use in your configuration. Unlike resource blocks that create and manage infrastructure, data sources provide read-only access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform provides a wide range of data sources for various cloud providers and external systems. Some common data sources include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `aws_instance`: Fetch information about an Amazon EC2 instance\n",
    "- `google_compute_instance`: Retrieve details about a Google Compute Engine instance\n",
    "- `azurerm_resource_group`: Query Azure Resource Group information\n",
    "- `local_file`: Access data from local files on the machine where Terraform is running\n",
    "- `template_file`: Generate dynamic templates based on input data\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a data source in Terraform, you need to define it within your configuration using the `data` block. This block specifies the type of data source you want to query, and you can provide additional configuration settings as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "data \"aws_vpc\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  id = \"vpc-0123456789abcdef0\"  # Example VPC ID\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "resource \"aws_security_group\" \"example\" {\n",
    "  name        = \"example\"\n",

    "\n",
    "  # Using data source output in resource configuration\n",
    "  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.example.id\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the `data` `aws_vpc` data source retrieves details about an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with the specified ID. The `aws_security_group` resource then uses the VPC ID from the data source as an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've defined a data source, you can query it to retrieve specific information, such as attributes or IDs. The data retrieved from a data source can then be used elsewhere in your Terraform configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "data \"aws_instances\" \"example\" {\n",

    "    values = [\"production\"]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `filter` block is used within the `data \"aws_instances:` data source to specify filtering criteria for the instances you want to retrieve. It's a way to narrow down the results when querying data sources. The `data aws_instances` data source fetches information about all instances in AWS with the `Environment` tag set to `production`\n",
