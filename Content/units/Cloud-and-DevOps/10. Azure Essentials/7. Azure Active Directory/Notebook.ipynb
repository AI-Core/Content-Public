    "\n",
    "A *tenant* is a dedicated instance of Azure AD that an organization or company uses to manage identity and access for its users and applications. Each tenant has its own set of users, groups, and applications, and is isolated from other tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *directory* is a container that holds objects such as users, groups, and applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can have multiple directories in a single tenant, which can be useful for managing different groups of users or applications. Additionally, you can invite users from other Azure AD tenants to access your applications, which can help facilitate collaboration and streamline workflows.\n",

    "### Default Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The *default directory* is the directory that is created automatically when you create a new Azure AD tenant. This directory contains all of the objects that you need to manage user identities and their access to resources in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default directory has a globally unique name that is automatically generated by Azure when the tenant is created. You can change the name of the default directory in Azure Active Directory. However, it's worth noting that changing the name of the default directory can have implications for the configuration of your Azure AD tenant and the applications that rely on it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When you create a user in Azure AD, you can assign them to specific roles and groups that determine their level of access to resources in your organization. Azure AD provides several built-in roles that you can use to control access, as well as custom roles that you can create to suit your organization's needs.\n",

    "### Create a new user in Azure AD\n",
    "To create a new user in Azure AD, follow these steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "When creating a new user in Azure AD, you will be prompted to enter a *User Principal Name (UPN)* for the user. The UPN is a unique identifier for the user that is used for sign-in purposes. It typically takes the form of an email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *@domain* portion of the UPN represents the domain name that is associated with your Azure AD tenant. The domain name is typically the same as your organization's internet domain name, such as `aicore.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Password\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to set the password manually, you can enter a password that meets your organization's password complexity requirements. Alternatively, you can choose to let Azure AD auto-generate a password for the user. This can be useful if you want to ensure that the password meets a certain level of complexity and randomness. To generate a password, you can tick the **Auto-generate password** button in the **Password** field. Azure AD will then generate a strong, random password that you can copy (using the **Copy to clipboard** button) and share with the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, to create the user click **Review + create**, and once the validations have passed click **Create**. The deployment might take a couple of minutes to complete. You should then be able to see the newly created user in the users list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now sign in as the new user, using the **User Principal Name** and the password create in the previous steps. Once you have signed in as the new user, you will have access to the Azure resources that you have assigned to them based on their assigned roles and permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you did not assign any roles when creating the user in Azure AD, the user will have no permissions to access any resources in Azure by default.

    "*Microsoft 365 groups* are used for collaboration and communication within Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, SharePoint, and Outlook.

    "## Role-Based Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "*Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* is a security feature that allows you to control access to resources in Azure. With RBAC, you can assign roles to users, groups, and applications to control access to Azure resources at different levels, such as the subscription, resource group, or resource level.\n",
    "\n",

    "Azure RBAC provides three built-in roles:\n",
    "- *Owner*: This role has full access to all resources and can manage access to resources\n",
    "- *Contributor*: This role can create and manage all resources but cannot grant access to others\n",
    "- *Reader*: This role can view all resources but cannot make any changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assign roles in Azure AD\n",
    "\n",
    "When you assign roles in Azure AD, you are assigning roles at the Azure AD level. These roles apply to all Azure resources that the user has access to within the Azure AD tenant. In other words, the user can perform actions on all resources that they have access to within the Azure AD tenant.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a role to a user or group in Azure AD, you must follow these steps:\n",
    "- Navigate to the resource you want to assign the role to. For example, the user we have previously created.\n",
    "- Click on **Assigned roles** in the left-hand menu\n",

    "- Click **Save** to assign the role\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assign roles using Azure's IAM feature\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Azure's *Access Control (IAM) feature* allows you to manage access to Azure resources at a more granular level. With IAM, you can assign roles to users, groups, and applications for specific Azure resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, or databases. IAM roles apply only to the specific resource or resource group to which they are assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using IAM to allow access to a user to a virtual machine in Azure:\n",
    "- Navigate to the virtual machine in the Azure portal\n",
    "- Select **Access control (IAM)** from the left-hand menu\n",
    "- Click on the **Add** button and then **Add role assignment** to add a new role assignment\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/AddRoleAssignment.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **Add role assignment** panel, select the appropriate role (e.g. **Virtual Machine Contributor**) from the dropdown menu. Click **Next** to proceed to the **Members** section\n",
    "- In the **Assign access to** section, select **User, group, or service principal**\n",
    "- Search for and select the user you want to grant access to\n",
    "- Click **Select** to complete the role assignment and then finish assigning this role\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the role assignment is saved, the user will have the appropriate permissions to perform actions on the virtual machine based on the role that was assigned. For example, if the user was assigned the **Virtual Machine Contributor** role, they would be able to start, stop, and restart the virtual machine, but would not be able to delete the virtual machine or modify its network settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Therefore, if you want to assign roles to a user or group for a specific Azure resource or resource group, you would use IAM. If you want to assign roles to a user or group at the Azure AD level, you would use the Azure AD **Assigned Roles** feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that IAM roles take precedence over Azure AD roles. So, if a user is assigned a role in IAM and a role in Azure AD, the IAM role will apply when the user is accessing the resource.\n"
