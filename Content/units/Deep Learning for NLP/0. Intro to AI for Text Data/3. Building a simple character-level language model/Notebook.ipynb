    "- Build your first language model to generate rap lyrics\n",

    "## What is Language Modelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a sequence of words, the language model assigns a probability to each possible word that might come next in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/Language%20Model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is the process of predicting the next word in a sequence of words based on the context provided by the previous words. It is a core task in natural language processing (NLP) and is used in a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, machine translation, and chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be used to predict the next word in a sequence, generate text that is similar to a given input, or to evaluate the quality of a translation or a summary by comparing the probability of the generated text to the probability of the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's easy to acquire data for training language models because the label is simply the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are typically trained on large corpora of text, such as books, articles, and websites, in order to learn the statistical properties of the language and the dependencies between words. They can be implemented using various types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or transformers."
