    "In programming, a tree is a data structure that simulates a hierarchical structure. Trees are a very important data structure because they are used to represent the structure of a large amount of data. Similar to a Linked List, a tree is a collection of nodes that are linked, but in this case, they are not linearly connected. Trees have a lot of applications, and are a very important part of the data science community.\r\n",
