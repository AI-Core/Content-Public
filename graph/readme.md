# AiCore Content Tree Viewer

### Instructions

1. Install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) and [PyGraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the remaining requirements ([psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html))
3. Run `main.py` to open a visualization of the content graph.

### Guidance for adding prerequisites

Prerequisites for a module should ONLY consist of the group of modules which should be studied directly prior to studying that module. There should be no "shortcuts" in the content graph, as this will result in some content being skipped or misplaced in the final generated pathway.
