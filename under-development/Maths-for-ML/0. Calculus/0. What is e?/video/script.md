<!-- TODO mathematical lesson on e -->

- e is a special mathematical number
- why is it special?
- well whenever you differentiate an exponential function, it gives you another exponential function

_Show graph with different exponential functions and their derivatives in dashed lines_

- for numbers above e, the differentiated function is steeper
- for numbers below e, the differentiated function is smaller
- when you differentiate e^x, you get exactly the same back, e^x

- that's because when you differentiate e^x it gives you e^x
- that's useful for many reasons, which i won't go into here

- ok we're back from the recap of e

- so how does the sigmoid function push a number between 0 and 1?

- as the input gets larger, this term goes to 0

_Point at the e^-z_

- and that means that the fraction becomes 1 divided by 1, and tends to 1
- when the input gets further below zero, this term becomes huge
- that means that the fraction becomes 1 divided by a large number, and tends to zero

- you can also multiply top and bottom by e^x to get this other form

_Show other form_
