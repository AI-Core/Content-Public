    In this practical, you will be creating directories and files. 
    
    1. Navigate to your home directory and create a directory called `Test`
    2. Change directory to the newly created `Test` directory
    3. Check that you are now in the `Test` directory
    4. Inside the `Test` directory, create another directory called `Example`
    5. Create 2 files called `myfile.txt` and `another_file.txt` inside the `Example` directory
    5. Navigate back to the `Test` directory
    6. In the `Test` directory, create a file called `test_file.txt`

    1. Move `another_file.txt` file from the `Example` directory into the `Test` directory
    2. List the items in the `Test` directory to confirm that the `example_file.txt` has been moved
    3. List the items in the `Example` directory to confirm that the `example.txt` file has been moved out of the directory
    4. Copy `myfile.txt` into the `Test` directory
    5  Check both directories to ensure that `myfile.txt` exists in both
    6. Remove `myfile.txt` from `Example` directory.
