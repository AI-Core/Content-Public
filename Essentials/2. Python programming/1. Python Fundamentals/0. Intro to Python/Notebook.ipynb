    "- Can have many uses (networks, games, graphics, apps).\n",
    "- We are focusing on data science applications of Python.\n",

    "- Integrated Development Environment: a place to write programs in a language.\n",
    "- Most famous for Python are PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook (also Spyder) and VS Code.\n",
    "- We will use Jupyter Notebook (advantages/drawbacks will be clear over time).\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook works using cells.\n",
    "- You input your code into each cell and then run the code per cell.\n",
    "- Each cell acts as a 'mini-script' which can be executed independently of other cells.\n",
    "- The file type of a Jupyter Notebook is a __.ipynb file__ (IPython NoteBook).\n",
    "- .ipynb files cannot be opened directly by any program on your computer; rather, you have to open Jupyter Notebook first and then open the file from inside it. This is due to the structure of the file (too complicated to cover here).\n",
    "- The other common type of Python file is a .py script: this is a single file written usually in a text editor, and when it is executed, the entirety of the code runs in one go, rather than individual blocks.\n",
    "- .py scripts can be opened using any text editor including TextEdit on Mac or the equivalent on Windows (also other text editors)."

    "- A comment is a piece of text added to code to explain it and make it easier to understand for anyone reading who isn't the author.\n",
    "- \\# at the start of a line indicates that a line is a comment in a code cell.\n",
    "- There are 2 schools of thought on comments: some argue that comments should be used extensively, others argue they should be minimal as the code should be self-explanatory.\n",
    "- Do not be afraid of adding quite a lot of comments at first; as you get better at coding you will begin to realise what requires a comment and what doesn't.\n",
    "- Remember __readability and reproducibility are paramount__. Use this to guide your usage of comments."
